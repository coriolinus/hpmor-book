# HPMOR Book

[_Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality_](http://www.hpmor.com/) is a very good book. Unfortunately, its presentation leaves something to be desired: its styling and presentation feels very much like it came straight from fanfiction.net, which isn't ideal when what you want is a nice ebook.

This project attempts to build a better ebook, with authors' notes, omake, and other distractions from the actual text moved into appendices.
