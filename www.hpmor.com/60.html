<p>"Wake."</p>
<p>Harry's eyes flew open as he came awake with a choking gasp, a
jerking start of his prone body. He couldn't remember any dreams,
maybe his brain had been too exhausted to dream, it seemed like
he'd only closed his eyes and then heard that word spoken a moment
after.</p>
<p>"You must awaken," said the voice of Quirinus Quirrell. "I gave
you as much time as I could, but it would be wise to reserve at
least one use of your Time-Turner. Soon we must go backward four
hours to Mary's Place, appearing in every way as though we have
done nothing interesting this day. I wished to speak to you before
then."</p>
<p>Harry slowly sat up in the midst of darkness. His body ached,
and not only in the places where it had laid on the hard concrete.
Images tumbled over each other in his memory, everything his
unconscious brain had been too tired to discharge into a proper
nightmare.</p>
<p>Twelve terrible voids floating down a metal corridor, tarnishing
the metal around them, light dimmed and temperature falling as the
emptiness tried to suck all life out of the world -</p>
<p>Chalk-white skin, stretched just above the bone that had
remained after fat and muscle faded -</p>
<p>A metal door -</p>
<p>A woman's voice -</p>
<p><em>No, I didn't mean it, please don't die -</em></p>
<p><em>I can't remember my children's names any more -</em></p>
<p><em>Don't go, don't take it away, don't don't don't -</em></p>
<p>"What was that place?" Harry said hoarsely, in a voice pushed
out of his throat like water forced through a too-thin pipe, in the
darkness it sounded almost as shattered as Bellatrix Black's voice
had been. "<em>What was that place? That wasn't a prison, that was
HELL!</em> "</p>
<p>"Hell?" said the calm voice of the Defense Professor. "You mean
the Christian punishment fantasy? I suppose there is a
similarity."</p>
<p>"How -" Harry's voice was blocking, there was something huge
lodged in his throat. "How - how could they -" <em>People</em> had
built that place, someone had <em>made</em> Azkaban, they'd made it
on <em>purpose,</em> they'd done it <em>deliberately,</em> that
woman, she'd had children, children she wouldn't remember, some
judge had <em>decided</em> for that to happen to her, someone had
needed to <em>drag</em> her into that cell and lock its door while
she screamed, someone fed her every day and walked away <em>without
letting her out</em> -</p>
<p>"<em>HOW COULD PEOPLE DO THAT?</em> "</p>
<p>"Why shouldn't they?" said the Defense Professor. A pale blue
light lit the warehouse, then, showing a high, cavernous concrete
ceiling, and a dusty concrete floor; and Professor Quirrell sitting
some distance away from Harry, leaning his back against a painted
wall; the pale blue light turned the walls to glacier surfaces, the
dust on the floor to speckled snow, and the man himself had become
an ice sculpture, shrouded in darkness where his black robes lay
over him. "What use are the prisoners of Azkaban to them?"</p>
<p>Harry's mouth opened in a croak. No words exited.</p>
<p>A faint smile twitched on the Defense Professor's lips. "You
know, Mr. Potter, if He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named had come to rule over
magical Britain, and built such a place as Azkaban, he would have
built it because he enjoyed seeing his enemies suffer. And if
instead he began to find their suffering distasteful, why, he would
order Azkaban torn down the next day. As for those who did make
Azkaban, and those who do not tear it down, while preaching lofty
sermons and imagining themselves <em>not</em> to be villains...
well, Mr. Potter, I think if I had my choice of taking tea with
them, or taking tea with You-Know-Who, I should find my
sensibilities less offended by the Dark Lord."</p>
<p>"I don't understand," Harry said, his voice was shaking, he'd
read about the classic experiment on the psychology of prisons, the
ordinary college students who had turned sadistic as soon as they
were assigned the role of prison guards; only now he realized that
the experiment hadn't examined the right question, the one most
important question, they hadn't looked at the key people, not the
prison guards but <em>everyone else,</em> "I really don't
understand, Professor Quirrell, how can people just stand by and
let this happen, <em>why</em> is the country of magical Britain
<em>doing this</em> -" Harry's voice stopped.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor's eyes appeared to be the same color as
always, in the pale blue light, for that light was the same color
as Quirinus Quirrell's irises, those never-thawing chips of ice.
"Welcome, Mr. Potter, to your first encounter with the realities of
politics. What do the wretched creatures in Azkaban have to offer
any faction? Who would benefit from aiding them? A politician who
openly sided with them would associate themselves with criminals,
with weakness, with distasteful things that people would rather not
think about. Alternatively, the politician could demonstrate their
might and cruelty by calling for longer sentences; to make a
display of strength requires a victim to crush beneath you, after
all. And the populace applauds, for it is their instinct to back
the winner." A coldly amused laugh. "You see, Mr. Potter, no one
ever quite believes that <em>they</em> will go to Azkaban, so they
see no harm in it for themselves. As for what they inflict on
others... I suppose you were once told that people care about that
sort of thing? It is a lie, Mr. Potter, people don't care in the
slightest, and if you had not led a vastly sheltered childhood you
would have noticed that long ago. Console yourself with this: those
now prisoner in Azkaban voted for the same Ministers of Magic who
pledged to move their cells closer to the Dementors. I admit, Mr.
Potter, that I see little hope for democracy as an effective form
of government, but I admire the poetry of how it makes its victims
complicit in their own destruction."</p>
<p>Harry's recently cohered self was threatening to shatter into
fragments again, the words falling like hammerstrikes on his
consciousness, driving him back, step by step, over the precipice
where lurked some vast abyss; and he was trying to find something
to save himself, some clever retort that would refute the words,
but it did not come.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor watched Harry, the gaze reflecting more
curiosity than command. "It is very simple, Mr. Potter, to
understand how Azkaban was built, and how it continues to be. Men
care for what they, themselves, expect to suffer or gain; and so
long as they do not expect it to redound upon themselves, their
cruelty and carelessness is without limit. All the other wizards of
this country are no different within than he who sought to rule
over them, You-Know-Who; they only lack his power and his...
frankness."</p>
<p>The boy's hands were clenched into fists so tightly that the
nails cut into his palm, if his fingers were white or his face was
pale you couldn't have seen that, for the dim blue light cast all
into ice or shadow. "You once offered to support me if my ambition
were to be the next Dark Lord. Is that why, Professor?"</p>
<p>The Defense Professor inclined his head, a thin smile on his
lips. "Learn all that I have to teach you, Mr. Potter, and you will
rule this country in time. Then you may tear down the prison that
democracy made, if you find that Azkaban still offends your
sensibilities. Like it or not, Mr. Potter, you have seen this day
that your own will conflicts with the will of this country's
populace, and that you do not bow your head and submit to their
decision when that occurs. So to them, whether or not they know it,
and whether or not you acknowledge it, you are their next Dark
Lord."</p>
<p>In the monochromatic light, unwavering, the boy and the Defense
Professor both seemed like motionless ice sculptures, the irises of
their eyes reduced to similar colors, looking very much the same in
that light.</p>
<p>Harry stared directly into those pale eyes. All the
long-suppressed questions, the ones he'd told himself he was
putting on hold until the Ides of May. That had been a lie, Harry
now knew, a self-deception, he had kept silent for fear of what he
might hear. And now everything was coming forth from his lips, all
at once. "On our first day of class, you tried to convince my
classmates I was a killer."</p>
<p>"You are." Amusedly. "But if your question is why I
<em>told</em> them that, Mr. Potter, the answer is that you will
find ambiguity a great ally on your road to power. Give a sign of
Slytherin on one day, and contradict it with a sign of Gryffindor
the next; and the Slytherins will be enabled to believe what they
wish, while the Gryffindors argue themselves into supporting you as
well. So long as there is uncertainty, people can believe whatever
seems to be to their own advantage. And so long as you appear
strong, so long as you appear to be winning, their instincts will
tell them that their advantage lies with you. Walk always in the
shadow, and light and darkness both will follow."</p>
<p>"And," said the boy, his voice level, "just what do <em>you</em>
want out of all this?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had leaned further back against the wall from
where he sat, casting his face into shadow, his eyes changing from
pale ice into dark pits like those of his snake form. "I wish for
Britain to grow strong under a strong leader; that <em>is</em> my
desire. As for my reasons why," Professor Quirrell smiled without
mirth, "I think they shall stay my own."</p>
<p>"The sense of doom that I feel around you." The words were
becoming harder and harder to say, as the subject danced closer and
closer to something terrible and forbidden. "You always knew what
it meant."</p>
<p>"I had several guesses," said Professor Quirrell, his expression
unreadable. "And I will not yet say all I guessed. But this much I
will tell you: it is <em>your</em> doom which flares when we come
near, not mine."</p>
<p>For once Harry's brain managed to mark this as a questionable
assertion and possible lie, instead of believing everything it
heard. "Why do you sometimes turn into a zombie?"</p>
<p>"Personal reasons," said Professor Quirrell with no humor at all
in his voice.</p>
<p>"What was your ulterior motive for rescuing Bellatrix?"</p>
<p>There was a brief silence, during which Harry tried hard to
control his breathing, keep it steady.</p>
<p>Finally the Defense Professor shrugged, as though it were of no
account. "I all but spelled it out for you, Mr. Potter. I told you
everything you needed to deduce the answer, if you had been mature
enough to consider that first obvious question. Bellatrix Black was
the Dark Lord's most powerful servant, her loyalty the most
assured; she was the single person most likely to be entrusted with
some part of the lost lore of Slytherin that should have been
yours."</p>
<p>Slowly the anger crept over Harry, slowly the wrath, something
terrible beginning to boil his blood, in just a few moments he
would say something that he really shouldn't say while the two of
them were alone in a deserted warehouse -</p>
<p>"But she <em>was</em> innocent," said the Defense Professor. He
was not smiling. "And the degree to which all her choices were
taken away from her, so that she never had a chance to suffer for
her <em>own</em> mistakes... it struck me as <em>excessive</em>,
Mr. Potter. If she tells you nothing of use -" The Defense
Professor gave another small shrug. "I shall not consider this
day's work a waste."</p>
<p>"How altruistic of you," Harry said coldly. "So if all wizards
are like You-Know-Who inside, are you an exception to that,
then?"</p>
<p>The Defense Professor's eyes were still in shadow, dark pits
that could not be met. "Call it a whim, Mr. Potter. It has
sometimes amused me to play the part of a hero. Who knows but that
You-Know-Who would say the same."</p>
<p>Harry opened his mouth a final time -</p>
<p>And found that he couldn't say it, he couldn't ask the last
question, the last and most important question, he couldn't make
the words come out. Even though a refusal like that was forbidden
to a rationalist, for all that he'd ever recited the Litany of
Tarski or the Litany of Gendlin or sworn that whatever could be
destroyed by the truth should be, in that one moment, he could not
bring himself to say his last question out loud. Even though he
knew he was thinking wrongly, even though he knew he was supposed
to be better than this, he still couldn't say it.</p>
<p>"Now it is my turn to inquire of you." Professor Quirrell's back
straightened from where it had leaned back against the glacier wall
of painted concrete. "I was wondering, Mr. Potter, if you had
anything to say about nearly killing me and ruining our mutual
endeavor. I am given to understand that an apology, in such cases,
is considered a sign of respect. But you have not offered me one.
Is it just that you have not yet gotten around to it, Mr.
Potter?"</p>
<p>The tone was calm, the quiet edge so fine and sharp that it
would slice all the way through you before you realized you were
being murdered.</p>
<p>And Harry just looked at the Defense Professor with cool eyes
that would never flinch from anything; not even death, now. He was
no longer in Azkaban, no longer fearful of the part of himself that
was fearless; and the solid gemstone that was Harry had rotated to
meet the stress, turning smoothly from one facet to another, from
light to darkness, warm to cold.</p>
<p><em>A calculated ploy on his part, to make me feel guilty, put
me in a position where I must submit?</em></p>
<p><em>Genuine emotion on his part?</em></p>
<p>"I see," said Professor Quirrell. "I suppose that answers -"</p>
<p>"No," said the boy in a cool, collected voice, "you do not get
to frame the conversation that easily, Professor. I went to
considerable lengths to protect you and get you out of Azkaban
safely, <em>after</em> I thought you had tried to kill a police
officer. That included facing down twelve Dementors without a
Patronus Charm. I wonder, if I had apologized when you demanded it,
would you have said thank-you in turn? Or am I correct in thinking
that it was my submission you demanded there, and not only my
respect?"</p>
<p>There was a pause, and then Professor Quirrell's voice came in
reply, openly icy with danger no longer veiled. "It seems you still
cannot bring yourself to lose, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>Darkness stared out of Harry's eyes without flinching, the
Defense Professor himself reduced to a mortal thing within them.
"Oh, and are <em>you</em> pondering now, whether <em>you</em>
should pretend to lose to me, and pretend to humble yourself before
my own anger, in order to preserve your own plans? Did the thought
of a calculated false apology even <em>cross your mind?</em> Me
neither, Professor Quirrell."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor laughed, low and humorless, emptier than
the void between the stars, dangerous as any vacuum filled with
hard radiation. "No, Mr. Potter, you have not learned your lesson,
not at all."</p>
<p>"I thought of losing many times, in Azkaban," said the boy, his
voice level. "That I ought to simply give up, and turn myself over
to the Aurors. Losing would have been the sensible thing to do. I
heard your voice saying it to me, in my mind; and I would have
<em>done</em> it, if I had been there by myself. But I could not
bring myself to lose <em>you</em>."</p>
<p>There was silence, then, for a time; as though even the Defense
Professor could not quite think of what to say to that.</p>
<p>"I am curious," said Professor Quirrell at last. "What do you
think that I should apologize for, precisely? I gave you explicit
instructions in the event of a fight. You were to stay down, stay
out of the way, cast no magic. You violated those instructions and
brought down the mission."</p>
<p>"I made no decision," the boy said evenly, "there was no choice
in it, only a wish that the Auror should not die, and my Patronus
was there. For that wish to have never occurred, you should have
warned me that you might bluff using a Killing Curse. By default, I
assume that if you point your wand at someone and say Avada
Kedavra, it is because you want them dead. Shouldn't that be the
first rule of Unforgivable Curse Safety?"</p>
<p>"Rules are for duels," said the Defense Professor. Some of the
coldness had returned to his voice. "And dueling is a sport, not a
branch of Battle Magic. In a real fight, a curse which cannot be
blocked and <em>must</em> be dodged is an indispensable tactic. I
would have thought this obvious to you, but it seems I misjudged
your intellect."</p>
<p>"It also seems to me imprudent," said the boy, continuing as
though the other had not spoken, "to not <em>tell me</em> that my
casting any spell on you might kill us both. What if you had
suffered some mishap, and I had tried an Innervate, or a Hover
Charm? That ignorance, which you permitted for purposes I cannot
guess, played also some part in this catastrophe."</p>
<p>There was another silence. The Defense Professor's eyes had
narrowed, and there was a faintly puzzled look on his face, as
though he had encountered some completely unfamiliar situation; and
still the man spoke no word.</p>
<p>"Well," said the boy. His eyes had not wavered from the Defense
Professor's. "I certainly regret hurting you, Professor. But I do
not think the situation calls for me to submit to you. I never
really did understand the concept of apology, still less as it
applies to a situation like this; if you have my regrets, but not
my submission, does that count as saying sorry?"</p>
<p>Again that cold, cold laugh, darker than the void between the
stars.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't know," said the Defense Professor, "I, too, never
understood the concept of apology. That ploy would be futile
between us, it seems, with both of us knowing it for a lie. Let us
speak no more of it, then. Debts will be settled between us in
time."</p>
<p>There was silence for a time.</p>
<p>"By the way," said the boy. "Hermione Granger would never have
built Azkaban, no matter who was going to be put in it. And she'd
die before she hurt an innocent. Just mentioning that, since you
said before that all wizards are like You-Know-Who inside, and
that's just false as a point of simple fact. Would've realized it
earlier if I hadn't been," the boy gave a brief grim smile,
"stressed out."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor's eyes were half-lidded, his expression
distant. "People's insides are not always like their outsides, Mr.
Potter. Perhaps she simply wishes others to think of her as a good
girl. She cannot use the Patronus Charm -"</p>
<p>"Hah," said the boy; his smile seemed realer now, warmer. "She's
having trouble for exactly the same reason I did. There's enough
light in her to destroy Dementors, I'm sure. She wouldn't be able
to <em>stop</em> herself from destroying Dementors, even at the
cost of her own life..." The boy trailed off, and then his voice
resumed. "<em>I</em> might not be such a good person, maybe; but
they do exist, and she's one of them."</p>
<p>Dryly. "She is young, and to make a show of kindness costs her
little."</p>
<p>There was a pause at this. Then the boy said, "Professor, I have
to ask, when you see something all dark and gloomy, doesn't it ever
occur to you to try and <em>improve</em> it somehow? Like, yes,
something goes terribly wrong in people's heads that makes them
think it's great to torture criminals, but that doesn't mean
they're truly evil inside; and maybe if you taught them the right
things, showed them what they were doing wrong, you could change
-"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell laughed, then, and not with the emptiness of
before. "Ah, Mr. Potter, sometimes I do forget how very young you
are. Sooner you could change the color of the sky." Another
chuckle, this one colder. "And the reason it is easy for you to
forgive such fools and think well of them, Mr. Potter, is that you
yourself have not been sorely hurt. You will think less fondly of
commonplace idiots after the first time their folly costs you
something dear. Such as a hundred Galleons from your own pocket,
perhaps, rather than the agonizing deaths of a hundred strangers."
The Defense Professor was smiling thinly. He took a pocket-watch
out of his robes, looked at it. "Let us depart now, if there is
nothing more to say between us."</p>
<p>"You don't have any questions about the impossible things I did
to get us out of Azkaban?"</p>
<p>"No," said the Defense Professor. "I believe I have solved most
of them already. As for the rest, it is too rare that I find a
person whom I cannot see through immediately, be they friend or
foe. I shall unravel the puzzles about you for myself, in due
time."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor shoved himself up, pushing back on the
wall with both hands and rising to his feet, smoothly if too
slowly. The boy, less gracefully, did the same.</p>
<p>And the boy blurted out the last most terrible question which he
had earlier been unable to ask; as though to say it aloud would
make it real, and as though it were not, already, vastly
obvious.</p>
<p>"Why am I not like the other children my own age?"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>In a deserted side-road of Diagon Alley, where scraps of
un-Vanished trash could be seen lodged into the edges of the brick
street and the blank brick building-sides that surrounded it, along
with scattered dirt and other signs of neglect, an ancient wizard
and his phoenix Apparated into existence.</p>
<p>The wizard was already reaching within his robes for his
hourglass when, in habit, his eyes jumped to a random spot between
the road and the wall, to memorize it -</p>
<p>And the old wizard blinked in surprise; there was a scrap of
parchment in that spot.</p>
<p>A frown crossed Albus Dumbledore's face as he took a step
forward and took the crumpled scrap, unfolding it.</p>
<p>On it was the single word "NO", and nothing more.</p>
<p>Slowly the wizard let it flutter from his fingers. Absently he
reached down to the pavement, and picked up the nearest scrap of
parchment, which looked remarkably similar to the one he had just
taken; he touched it with his wand, and a moment later it was
inscribed with the same word "NO", in the same handwriting, which
was his own.</p>
<p>The old wizard had planned to go back three hours to when Harry
Potter first arrived in Diagon Alley. He had already watched, upon
his instruments, the boy leaving Hogwarts, and that could not be
undone (his one attempt to fool his own instruments, and so control
Time without altering its appearance to himself, had ended in
sufficient disaster to convince him to never again try such
trickery). He had hoped to retrieve the boy at the first possible
moment after his arrival, and take him to another safe location, if
not Hogwarts (for his instruments had not shown the boy's return).
But now -</p>
<p>"A paradox if I retrieve him immediately after he arrives in
Diagon Alley?" murmured the old wizard to himself. "Perhaps they
did not set in motion their plan to rob Azkaban, until after they
had confirmed his arrival here... or else... perhaps..."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Painted concrete, hard floor and distant ceilings, two figures
facing off across from each other. One entity who wore the shape of
a man in his late thirties and already balding, and another mind
that wore the form of an eleven-year-old boy with a scar upon his
forehead. Ice and shadow, pale blue light.</p>
<p>"I don't know," said the man.</p>
<p>The boy just looked at him. And then said, "Oh, really?"</p>
<p>"Truly," said the man. "I know nothing, and of my guesses I will
not speak. Yet I will say this much -"</p>
