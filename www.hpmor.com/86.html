<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><em>Hypothesis: Voldemort<br /></em><em>(April 8th, 1992,
7:22pm)</em></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The four of them gathered once more around the ancient desk of
the Headmaster of Hogwarts, with its drawers within drawers within
drawers, wherein all the past paperwork of the Hogwarts School was
stored; legend had it that Headmistress Shehla had once gotten lost
in that desk, and was, in fact, still there, and wouldn't be let
out again until she got her files organized. Minerva didn't
particularly look forward to inheriting those drawers, when she
inherited that desk someday - if any of them survived.</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore was seated behind his desk, looking grave and
composed.</p>
<p>Severus Snape was standing next to the dead Floo and its ashes,
hovering ominously like the vampire that students sometimes accused
him of pretending to be.</p>
<p>Mad-Eye Moody had been meant to join them, but was yet to
arrive.</p>
<p>And Harry...</p>
<p>A boy's small, thin frame, perched on the arm of his chair, as
though the energies running through him were too great to allow
ordinary seating. Set face, sweaty hair, intent green eyes, and
within it all, the jagged lightning-bolt of his never-healing scar.
He seemed grimmer, now; even compared to a single week earlier.</p>
<p>For a moment Minerva flashed back to her trip to Diagon Alley
with Harry, what seemed like ages and ages ago. There'd been this
somber boy <em>inside</em> that Harry, somehow, even then. This
wasn't entirely her own fault, or Albus's fault. And yet there was
something almost unbearably sad about the contrast between the
young boy she'd first met, and what magical Britain had made of
him. Harry had never had much of an ordinary childhood, she'd
gathered; Harry's adoptive parents had said to her that he'd spoken
little and played less with Muggle children. It was painful to
think that Harry might have had only a few months of playing beside
the other children in Hogwarts, before the war's demands had
stripped it all away. Maybe there was another face that Harry
showed to the children his own age, when he wasn't staring down the
Wizengamot. But she couldn't stop herself from imagining Harry
Potter's childhood as a heap of firewood, and herself and Albus
feeding the wooden branches, piece by piece, into the flames.</p>
<p>"Prophecies are strange things," said Albus Dumbledore. The old
wizard's eyes were half-lidded, as though in weariness. "Vague,
unclear, meaning escaping like water held between loose fingers.
Prophecy is ever a burden, for there are no answers there, only
questions."</p>
<p>Harry Potter was sitting tensely. "Headmaster Dumbledore," said
the boy with soft precision, "my friends are being targeted.
Hermione Granger almost went to Azkaban. The war has begun, as you
put it. Professor Trelawney's prophecy is key information for
weighing up the balance of my hypotheses about what's going on. Not
to mention how silly it is - and <em>dangerous</em> - that the Dark
Lord knows the prophecy and <em>I don't</em>."</p>
<p>Albus looked a grim question at her, and she shook her head in
reply; in whatever unimaginable way Harry had discovered that
Trelawney had made the prophecy and that the Dark Lord knew of it,
he hadn't learned that much from her.</p>
<p>"Voldemort, seeking to avert that very prophecy, went to his
defeat at your hands," the old wizard said then. "His knowledge
brought him only harm. Ponder that carefully, Harry Potter."</p>
<p>"Yes, Headmaster, I do understand that. My home culture also has
a literary tradition of self-fulfilling and misinterpreted
prophecies. I'll interpret with caution, rest assured. But I've
already guessed quite a bit. Is it safer for me to work from
partial guesses?"</p>
<p>Time passed.</p>
<p>"Minerva," said Albus. "If you would."</p>
<p>"The one..." she began. The words came falteringly to her
throat; she was no actress. She couldn't imitate the deep, chilling
tone of the original prophecy; and yet somehow that tone seemed to
carry all the <em>meaning.</em> "The one with the power to vanquish
the Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied
him, born as the seventh month dies..."</p>
<p>"<em>And the Dark Lord shall mark him as his equal,</em>" came
Severus's voice, making her jump within her chair. The Potions
Master loomed tall by the fireplace. "<em>But he shall have power
the Dark Lord knows not... and either must destroy all but a
remnant of the other, for those two different spirits cannot exist
in the same world.</em>"</p>
<p>That last line Severus spoke with so much foreboding that it
chilled her bones; it was almost like listening to Sybill
Trelawney.</p>
<p>Harry was listening with a frown. "Can you repeat that?" said
Harry.</p>
<p>"<em>The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord
approaches, born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the
seventh month -</em>"</p>
<p>"Actually, hold on, can you write that down? I need to analyze
this <em>carefully</em> -"</p>
<p>This was done, with both Albus and Severus watching the
parchment hawklike, as though to make sure that no unseen hand
reached in and snatched the precious information away.</p>
<p>"Let's see..." Harry said. "I'm male and born on July 31st,
check. I did in fact vanquish the Dark Lord, check. Ambiguous
pronoun in line two... but I wasn't born yet so it's hard to see
how my parents could have thrice defied <em>me.</em> This scar is
an obvious candidate for the mark..." Harry touched his forehead.
"Then there's the power the Dark Lord knows not, which probably
refers to my scientific background -"</p>
<p>"No," said Severus.</p>
<p>Harry looked at the Potions Master in surprise.</p>
<p>Severus's eyes were closed, his face tightened in concentration.
"The Dark Lord could obtain that power by studying the same books
as you, Potter. But the prophecy did not say, <em>power the Dark
Lord has not.</em> Nor even, <em>power the Dark Lord cannot
have.</em> She spoke of <em>power the Dark Lord knows not</em>...
it will be something stranger to him than Muggle artifacts.
Something perhaps that he cannot comprehend at all, even having
seen it..."</p>
<p>"Science is not a bag of technological tricks," Harry said.
"It's not just the Muggle version of a wand. It's not even
knowledge like memorizing the periodic table. It's a different way
of <em>thinking.</em>"</p>
<p>"Perhaps..." the Potions Master murmured, but his voice was
skeptical.</p>
<p>"It is hazardous," Albus said, "to read too far into a prophecy,
even if you have heard it yourself. They are things of exceeding
frustration."</p>
<p>"So I see," Harry said. His hand rose up, rubbed the scar on his
forehead. "But... okay, if <em>this</em> is really all we know...
look, I'll just put it bluntly. How do you <em>know</em> that the
Dark Lord actually survived?"</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " she cried. Albus just sighed and leaned back
in the vast Headmaster's chair.</p>
<p>"Well," Harry said, "imagine how this prophecy sounded back when
it was made. You-Know-Who learns the prophecy, and it sounds like
I'm destined to grow up and overthrow him. That the two of us are
meant to have a final battle where either of us must destroy all
but a remnant of the other. So You-Know-Who attacks Godric's Hollow
and <em>immediately</em> gets vanquished, leaving behind
<em>some</em> remnant which may or may not be his disembodied soul.
Maybe the Death Eaters are his remnant, or the Dark Mark. This
prophecy could already be fulfilled, is what I'm saying. Don't get
me wrong - I do realize that my interpretation sounds stretched.
Trelawney's phrasing doesn't seem natural for describing
<em>only</em> the events that historically happened on October
31st, 1981. Attacking a baby and having the spell bounce off, isn't
something you'd normally call 'the power to vanquish'. But if you
think of the prophecy as being about <em>several</em> possible
futures, only <em>one</em> of which was actually realized on
Halloween, then the prophecy could already be complete."</p>
<p>"But -" Minerva blurted. "But the raid on Azkaban -"</p>
<p>"<em>If</em> the Dark Lord survived, then sure, he's the most
likely suspect for the Azkaban breakout," Harry said reasonably.
"You could even say that the Azkaban breakout is Bayesian evidence
for the Dark Lord surviving, because an Azkaban breakout is more
likely to happen in worlds where he's alive than worlds where he's
dead. But it's not <em>strong</em> Bayesian evidence. It's not
something that <em>can't possibly happen</em> unless the Dark Lord
is alive. Professor Quirrell, who <em>didn't</em> start from the
assumption that You-Know-Who was still around, had no trouble
thinking of his own explanation. To him, it was obvious that some
powerful wizard might want Bellatrix Black because she knew a
secret of the Dark Lord's, like some of his magical knowledge that
he'd told to only her. The priors against anyone surviving their
body's death are very low, even if it's magically possible.
<em>Most</em> times it doesn't happen. So if it's <em>just</em> the
Azkaban breakout... I'd have to say formally that it isn't enough
Bayesian evidence. The improbability of the evidence assuming that
the hypothesis is false, is not commensurate with the prior
improbability of the hypothesis."</p>
<p>"No," Severus said flatly. "The prophecy is not yet fulfilled. I
would know if it were."</p>
<p>"Are you <em>sure</em> of that?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Potter. If the prophecy had already come true, I would
<em>understand</em> it! I heard Trelawney's words, I remember
Trelawney's voice, and if I knew the events that matched the
prophecy, I would <em>recognize</em> them. What has already
happened... does <em>not</em> fit." The Potions Master spoke with
certainty.</p>
<p>"I'm not really sure what to do with that statement," Harry
said. His hand rose up, absently rubbed at his forehead. "Maybe
it's just what you <em>think</em> happened that doesn't fit, and
the true history is different..."</p>
<p>"Voldemort <em>is</em> alive," Albus said. "There are other
indications."</p>
<p>"Such as?" Harry's reply was instant.</p>
<p>Albus paused. "There are terrible rituals by which wizards have
returned from death," Albus said slowly. "That much, anyone can
discern within history and legend. And yet those books are missing,
I could not find them; it was Voldemort who removed them, I am sure
-"</p>
<p>"So you <em>can't</em> find any books on immortality, and that
proves that You-Know-Who has them?"</p>
<p>"Indeed," said Albus. "There is a certain book - I will not name
it aloud - missing from the Restricted Section of the Hogwarts
library. An ancient scroll which should have been at Borgin and
Burkes, with only an empty place on a shelf to show where it was -"
The old wizard stopped. "But I suppose," the old wizard said, as
though to himself, "you will say that even if Voldemort tried to
make himself immortal, it does not prove that he succeeded..."</p>
<p>Harry sighed. "Proof, Headmaster? There are only ever
probabilities. If there are known, particular books on immortality
rituals which are missing, that increases the probability that
someone attempted one. Which, in turn, raises the prior probability
of the Dark Lord surviving his death. This I concede, and thank you
for contributing the fact. The question is whether the prior
probability goes up <em>enough.</em>"</p>
<p>"Surely," Albus said quietly, "if you concede even a
<em>chance</em> that Voldemort survived, that is worth guarding
against?"</p>
<p>Harry inclined his head. "As you say, Headmaster. Though once a
probability drops low enough, it's also an error to go on obsessing
about it... Given that books on immortality are missing, and that
this prophecy would sound <em>somewhat</em> more natural if it
refers to the Dark Lord and I having a future battle, I agree that
the Dark Lord being alive is a probability, not just possibility.
But other probabilities must <em>also</em> be taken into account -
and in the probable worlds where You-Know-Who is <em>not</em>
alive, someone else framed Hermione."</p>
<p>"Foolishness," Severus said softly. "Utter foolishness. The Dark
Mark has not faded, nor has its master."</p>
<p>"See, <em>that's</em> what I mean by formally insufficient
Bayesian evidence. Sure, it sounds all grim and foreboding and
stuff, but is it <em>that</em> unlikely for a magical mark to stay
around after the maker dies? Suppose the mark is certain to
continue while the Dark Lord's sentience lives on, but <em>a
priori</em> we'd only have guessed a twenty percent chance of the
Dark Mark continuing to exist after the Dark Lord dies. Then the
observation, 'The Dark Mark has not faded' is five times as likely
to occur in worlds where the Dark Lord is alive as in worlds where
the Dark Lord is dead. Is that really commensurate with the prior
improbability of immortality? Let's say the prior odds were a
hundred-to-one against the Dark Lord surviving. If a hypothesis is
a hundred times as likely to be false versus true, and then you see
evidence five times more likely if the hypothesis is true versus
false, you should update to believing the hypothesis is twenty
times as likely to be false as true. Odds of a hundred to one,
times a likelihood ratio of one to five, equals odds of twenty to
one that the Dark Lord is dead -"</p>
<p>"<em>Where</em> are you getting all these numbers, Potter?"</p>
<p>"That <em>is</em> the admitted weakness of the method," Harry
said readily. "But what I'm <em>qualitatively</em> getting at is
why the observation, 'The Dark Mark has not faded', is not adequate
support for the hypothesis, 'The Dark Lord is immortal.' The
evidence isn't as extraordinary as the claim." Harry paused. "Not
to mention that even if the Dark Lord is alive, he doesn't
<em>have</em> to be the one who framed Hermione. As a cunning man
once said, there could be more than one plotter and more than one
plan."</p>
<p>"Such as the Defense Professor," Severus said with a thin smile.
"I suppose I must agree that he is a suspect. It was the Defense
Professor last year, after all; and the year before that, and the
year before <em>that</em>."</p>
<p>Harry's eyes dropped back to the parchment in his lap. "Let's
move on. Are we <em>certain</em> that this Prophecy is accurate?
Nobody messed with Professor McGonagall's memory, maybe edited or
subtracted a line?"</p>
<p>Albus paused, then spoke slowly. "There is a great spell laid
over Britain, recording every prophecy said within our borders. Far
beneath the Most Ancient Hall of the Wizengamot, in the Department
of Mysteries, they are recorded."</p>
<p>"The Hall of Prophecy," Minerva whispered. She'd read about that
place, said to be a great room of shelves filled with glowing orbs,
one after another appearing over the years. Merlin himself had
wrought it, it was said; the greatest wizard's final slap to the
face of Fate. Not all prophecies conduced to the good; and Merlin
had wished for at least those spoken of in prophecy, to know what
had been spoken <em>of</em> them. That was the respect Merlin had
given to their free will, that Destiny might not control them from
the outside, unwitting. Those mentioned within a prophecy would
have an glowing orb float to their hand, and then hear the
prophet's true voice speaking. Others who tried to touch an orb, it
was said, would be driven mad - or possibly just have their heads
explode, the legends were unclear on this point. Whatever Merlin's
original intention, the Unspeakables hadn't let anyone enter in
centuries, so far as she'd heard. <em>Works of the Ancient
Wizards</em> had stated that later Unspeakables had discovered that
tipping off the subjects of prophecies could interfere with seers
releasing whatever temporal pressures they released; and so the
heirs of Merlin had sealed his Hall. It did occur to Minerva to
wonder (now that she'd spent a few months around Mr. Potter) how
anyone could possibly <em>know</em> that; but she also knew better
than to ask Albus, in case Albus tried to tell her. Minerva firmly
believed that you only ought to worry about Time if you were a
clock.</p>
<p>"The Hall of Prophecy," Albus confirmed lowly. "Those who are
spoken of in a prophecy, may listen to that prophecy there. Do you
see the implication, Harry?"</p>
<p>Harry frowned. "Well, I could listen to it, or the Dark Lord...
oh, my <em>parents</em>. Those who had thrice defied him. They were
also mentioned in the prophecy, so they could hear the
recording?"</p>
<p>"If James and Lily heard anything different from what Minerva
reported," Albus said evenly, "they did not say so to me."</p>
<p>"You took James and Lily <em>there?</em> " Minerva said.</p>
<p>"Fawkes can go to many places," Albus said. "Do not mention the
fact."</p>
<p>Harry was staring directly at Albus. "Can <em>I</em> go to this
Department of Mysteries place and hear the recorded prophecy? The
original tone of voice might be helpful, from what I've heard."</p>
<p>Light glinted from the reflection of Albus's half-moon glasses
as the old wizard slowly shook his head. "I think that would be
unwise," Albus said. "For reasons beyond the obvious. It is
dangerous, that place which Merlin made; more dangerous to some
people than others."</p>
<p>"I see," Harry said tonelessly, and looked back down at the
parchment. "I'll take the prophecy as assumed accurate for now. The
next part says that the Dark Lord has marked me as his equal. Any
ideas on what that means exactly?"</p>
<p>"Surely not," said Albus, "that you must imitate his ways, in
any wise."</p>
<p>"I'm not <em>dumb,</em> Headmaster. Muggles have worked out a
thing or two about temporal paradoxes, even if it's all theoretical
to them. I won't throw away my ethics just because a signal from
the future claims it's going to happen, because then that becomes
the only reason why it happened in the first place. Still, what
<em>does</em> it mean?"</p>
<p>"I do not know," said Severus.</p>
<p>"Nor I," she said.</p>
<p>Harry took out his wand, turned it over in his hands, gazing
meditatively at the wood. "Eleven inches, holly, with a core of
phoenix feather," Harry said. "And the phoenix whose tail feather
is in this wand, only ever gave one other, which Mr... what was his
name, Olive-something... made into the core of the Dark Lord's
wand. <em>And</em> I'm a Parselmouth. It seemed like a lot of
coincidence even then. And now I find out there's a prophecy
stating that I'll be the Dark Lord's equal."</p>
<p>Severus's eyes were thoughtful; the Headmaster's gaze,
unreadable.</p>
<p>"Could it be," Minerva said falteringly, "that You-Know-Who -
that Voldemort - transferred some of his own powers to Mr. Potter,
the night he gave him that scar? Not something he intended to do,
surely. Still... I don't see how Mr. Potter could be his
<em>equal,</em> if he had any less magic than the Dark Lord
himself..."</p>
<p>"Meh," said Harry, still looking meditatively at his wand. "I'd
fight the Dark Lord without any magic at all, if I had to. <em>Homo
sapiens</em> didn't become the dominant species on this planet by
having the sharpest claws or hardest armor - though I suppose some
of that point may be lost on wizards. Still, it's beneath my
dignity as a human being to be scared of anything that isn't
smarter than I am; and from what I've heard, on that particular
dimension the Dark Lord wasn't very scary."</p>
<p>The Potions Master spoke, his voice taking on some of his
customary contemptuous drawl. "You imagine yourself more
intelligent than the Dark Lord, Potter?"</p>
<p>"Yes, in fact," said Harry, pulling back the left sleeve of his
robes, and rolling up the shirtsleeve beneath to expose the bare
elbow. "Oh, that reminds me! Let's make sure nobody here has the
clearly visible tattoo in the standard, easily checkable location
which would mark them as a secret enemy spy."</p>
<p>Albus made a quieting gesture that halted the Potions Master
before he could say anything scathing. "Tell me, Harry," Albus
said, "how would <em>you</em> have crafted the Dark Mark?"</p>
<p>"Nonstandard locations," Harry said promptly, "not easily found
without embarrassment and fuss, though of course any
security-conscious person would check anyway. Make it smaller, if
possible. Overlay another non-magical tattoo to obscure the exact
shape - better yet, cover it with a layer of fake skin -"</p>
<p>"Cunning indeed," Albus said. "But tell me, suppose you could
craft any conditions you wished into the Mark, fading it or raising
it as you wished. What would you do then?"</p>
<p>"Make it completely invisible at all times," Harry said in tones
of stating the obvious. "You don't want there to be any detectable
difference between a spy and a non-spy."</p>
<p>"Suppose you are more cunning still," Albus said. "You are a
master of trickery, a master of deception, and you employ your
abilities to the fullest."</p>
<p>"Well -" The boy stopped, frowning. "It seems unnecessarily
complicated, more like a tactic a villain would use in a
role-playing game than something you'd try in a real-life war. But
I suppose you could put fake Dark Marks on people who aren't really
Death Eaters, and keep the Dark Marks on the real Death Eaters
invisible. But then there's the question of why people would start
believing in the first place that the Dark Mark identified a Death
Eater... I'd have to think about it for at least five minutes, if I
were going to take the problem seriously."</p>
<p>"I ask you this," Albus said, still in that mild tone, "because
I did indeed, in the early days of the war, perform such tests as
you suggested. The Order survived my folly only because Alastor did
not trust in the bare arms we saw. I had thought, afterward, that
the bearers of the Mark might hide it or show it at their will. And
yet when we hied Igor Karkaroff before the Wizengamot, that Mark
showed clear on his arm, for all that Karkaroff wished to protest
his innocence. What true rule may govern the Dark Mark, I do not
know. Even Severus is still bound by his Mark not to reveal its
secrets to any who do not know them."</p>
<p>"Oh, well <em>that</em> makes it <em>obvious</em>," Harry said
promptly. "Wait, hold on - you were a <em>Death Eater?</em> " Harry
transferred his stare to Severus.</p>
<p>Severus returned a thin smile. "I still am, so far as they
know."</p>
<p>"Harry," said Albus, eyes only for the boy. "What do you mean,
that makes it obvious?"</p>
<p>"Information theory 101," the boy said in a lecturing tone.
"Observing variable X conveys information about variable Y, if and
only if the possible values of X have different probabilities given
different states of Y. The instant you hear about anything
whatsoever that varies between a spy and a nonspy, you should
immediately think of exploiting it to distinguish spies from
nonspies. Similarly, to distinguish reality from lies, you need a
process which behaves differently in the presence of truth and
falsehood - that's why 'faith' doesn't work as a discriminant,
while 'make experimental predictions and test them' does. You say
someone with the Dark Mark can't reveal its secrets to anyone who
doesn't already know them. So to find out how the Dark Mark
operates, write down every way you can imagine the Dark Mark
<em>might</em> work, then watch Professor Snape try to tell each of
those things to a confederate - maybe one who doesn't know what the
experiment is about - I'll explain binary search later so that you
can play Twenty Questions to narrow things down - and whatever he
<em>can't</em> say out loud is true. His silence would be something
that behaves differently in the presence of true statements about
the Mark, versus false statements, you see."</p>
<p>Minerva's mouth was hanging open, she realized; and she closed
it abruptly. Even Albus looked surprised.</p>
<p>"And after that, like I said, <em>any</em> behavioral difference
between spies and nonspies can be used to identify spies. Once
you've identified at least one magically censored secret of the
Dark Mark, you can test someone for the Dark Mark by seeing if they
can reveal that secret to somebody who doesn't already know it
-"</p>
<p><em>"Thank you, Mr. Potter."</em></p>
<p>Everyone looked at Severus. The Potions Master was
straightening, his teeth bared in a grimace of angry triumph.
"Headmaster, I can now speak freely of the Mark. If we know we are
caught for a Death Eater, before others who have not yet seen our
bare arms, our Mark reveals itself whether we will it or no. But if
they have already seen our arms bare, it does not reveal itself;
nor if we are only being tested from suspicion. Thus the Dark Mark
seems to identify Death Eaters - but only those already found, you
perceive."</p>
<p>"Ah..." Albus said. "Thank you, Severus." He closed his eyes
briefly. "That would indeed explain why Black escaped even Peter's
notice... ah, well. And Harry's proposed test?"</p>
<p>The Potions Master shook his head. "The Dark Lord was no fool,
despite Potter's delusions. The moment such a test is suspected,
the Mark ceases to bind our tongues. Yet I could not hint at the
possibility, but only wait for another to deduce it." Another thin
smile. "I would award you a good many House points, Mr. Potter, if
it would not compromise my cover. But as you can see, the Dark Lord
was quite cunning." His gaze grew more distant. "Oh," Severus
breathed, "he was <em>very</em> cunning indeed..."</p>
<p>Harry Potter sat still for a long moment.</p>
<p>Then -</p>
<p>"No," Harry said. The boy shook his head. "No, that can't
<em>actually</em> be true. First of all, we're talking about the
kind of logic puzzle that would appear in chapter <em>one</em> of a
Raymond Smullyan book, nowhere <em>near</em> the level of what
Muggle scientists do for a living. And second, for all I know, it
took the Dark Lord five months of thinking to invent the puzzle I
just solved in five seconds -"</p>
<p>"Is it <em>that</em> inconceivable to you, Potter, that anyone
could be so intelligent as yourself?" The Potions Master's voice
held more curiosity than scorn.</p>
<p>"It's called a base rate, Professor Snape. The evidence is
equally compatible with the Dark Lord inventing that puzzle over
the course of five months or over the course of five seconds, but
in any given population there'll be many more people who can do it
in five months than in five seconds..." Harry pasted a hand against
his forehead. "Darn it, how can I explain this? I suppose, from
your perspective, the Dark Lord came up with a clever puzzle and I
cleverly solved it and that makes us look <em>equal</em>."</p>
<p>"I remember your first day of Potions class," the Potions Master
said dryly. "I think you have a ways still to go."</p>
<p>"Peace, Severus," Albus said. "Harry has already accomplished
more than you know. Yet tell me, Harry - why <em>do</em> you
believe the Dark Lord is less than you? Surely he is a damaged soul
in many ways. But cunning for cunning - you are not yet ready to
face him, I would judge; and I know the full tally of your
deeds."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The frustrating thing about this conversation was that Harry
<em>couldn't say his actual reasons for disagreeing,</em> which
violated several basic principles of cooperative discourse.</p>
<p>He couldn't explain how Bellatrix had really been removed from
Azkaban - not by You-Know-Who in any guise, but by the combined
wits of Harry and Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>Harry didn't want to say in front of Professor McGonagall that
the existence of brain damage implied that there were no such
things as souls. Which made a successful immortality ritual...
well, not <em>impossible,</em> Harry certainly intended to forge a
road to magical immortality <em>someday</em>, but it would be a
<em>lot harder</em> and require <em>much more ingenuity</em> than
just binding an already-existent soul to a lich's phylactery. Which
no intelligent wizard would bother doing in the first place, if
they knew their souls were immortal.</p>
<p>And the true and honest reason Harry knew the Dark Lord couldn't
have been <em>that</em> smart... well... there wasn't any tactful
way to say it, but...</p>
<p>Harry had <em>been</em> to a convocation of the Wizengamot. He'd
<em>seen</em> the laughable 'security precautions', if you could
call them that, guarding the deepest levels of the Ministry of
Magic. They didn't even have the Thief's Downfall which goblins
used to wash away Polyjuice and Imperius Curses on people entering
Gringotts. The obvious takeover route would be to Imperius the
Minister of Magic and a few department heads, and owl a hand
grenade to anyone too powerful to Imperius. Or owl them knockout
gas, if you needed them alive and in a state of Living Death to
take hairs for Polyjuice potions. Legilimency, False Memories, the
Confundus Charm - it was ridiculous, the magical world was
<em>supersaturated</em> with ways to cheat. Harry might not do any
of those things himself, during his own takeover of Britain, since
he was constrained by Ethics... well, Harry <em>might</em> do some
of the lesser ones, since Polyjuice or a temporary Confundus or
read-only Legilimency all sounded better than an extra day of
Azkaban... but...</p>
<p>If Harry hadn't been constrained by Ethics, it was possible he
could've wiped out the eviller sections of the Wizengamot that day;
all by himself, using only a first-year's magical power, on account
of being clever enough to figure out Dementors. Though Harry might
not have been in such a great political position after that, the
surviving Wizengamot members might've found it easy and cheap to
disavow his actions for P.R. purposes and condemn him, even if the
smarter ones realized it was for the greater good... but
<em>still.</em></p>
<p>If you were completely unrestrained by ethics, armed with the
ancient secrets of Salazar Slytherin, had dozens of powerful
followers including Lucius Malfoy, and it took you more than ten
years to <em>fail</em> to overthrow the government of magical
Britain, it meant you were stupid.</p>
<p>"How can I put this..." Harry said. "Look, Headmaster, you've
got ethics, there's a lot of battle tactics you don't use because
you're not evil. And you fought the Dark Lord, a tremendously
powerful wizard who wasn't so restrained, and you held him off
<em>anyway</em>. If You-Know-Who had been super-smart <em>on top of
that</em>, you'd be <em>dead.</em> <em>All</em> of you. You'd have
died <em>instantly -</em>"</p>
<p>"Harry," Professor McGonagall said. Her voice was faltering.
"Harry, we almost <em>did</em> all die. More than half the Order of
the Phoenix died. If not for Albus - Albus Dumbledore, the greatest
wizard in two centuries, Harry - we surely would have
perished."</p>
<p>Harry passed a hand across his forehead. "I'm sorry," Harry
said. "I'm not trying to minimize what you went through. I know
that You-Know-Who was a completely evil, incredibly powerful Dark
Wizard with dozens of powerful followers, and that's... bad, yes,
definitely bad. It's just..." <em>All that isn't on remotely the
same threat scale as the enemy being smart, in which case they
Transfigure botulinum toxin and sneak a millionth of a gram into
your teacup.</em> Was there any safe way to convey that concept
without citing specifics? Harry couldn't think of one.</p>
<p>"Please, Harry," said Professor McGonagall. "Please, Harry, I
beg you - <em>take the Dark Lord seriously!</em> He is more
dangerous than -" The senior witch seemed to be having trouble
finding words. "He is <em>far</em> more dangerous than
Transfiguration."</p>
<p>Harry's eyebrows went up before he could stop himself. A dark
chuckle came from Severus Snape's direction.</p>
<p><em>Um,</em> said the voice of Ravenclaw within him. <em>Um,
honestly Professor McGonagall is right, we're not taking this as
seriously as we'd take a scientific problem. The difficult thing is
to react</em> at all <em>to new information, instead of just
flushing it out the window. Right now it looks like we didn't shift
belief</em> at all <em>after encountering an unexpected, important
argument. Our dismissal of Lord Voldemort as a serious threat</em>
was <em>originally based on the Dark Mark being blatantly stupid.
It would require a focused effort to de-update and suspect the
whole garden-path of reasoning we went down based on that false
assumption, and we're</em> not <em>putting in that effort right
now.</em></p>
<p>"All right," Harry said, just as Professor McGonagall seemed to
be about to speak again. "All right, to take this seriously, I need
to stop and think for five minutes."</p>
<p>"Please do," said Albus Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Harry closed his eyes.</p>
<p>His Ravenclaw side divided into three.</p>
<p><em>Probability estimate,</em> said Ravenclaw One, who was
acting as moderator. <em>That the Dark Lord is alive, and as smart
as we are, and hence a genuine threat.</em></p>
<p><em>Why aren't all his enemies already dead?</em> said Ravenclaw
Two, who was prosecuting.</p>
<p><em>Note,</em> said Ravenclaw One, <em>we had already thought of
that argument so we can't use it to shift belief</em> again
<em>each time we rehearse it.</em></p>
<p><em>But what's the actual flaw in the logic?</em> said Ravenclaw
Two. <em>In worlds with a smart Lord Voldemort, everyone in the
Order of the Phoenix died in the first five minutes of the war. The
world doesn't look like that, so we don't live in that world.
QED.</em></p>
<p><em>Is that really certain?</em> asked Ravenclaw Three, who'd
been appointed as the defender. <em>Maybe there was some reason
Lord Voldemort</em> wasn't <em>fighting all-out back then
-</em></p>
<p><em>Like what?</em> demanded Ravenclaw Two. <em>Furthermore,
whatever your excuse, I demand that the probability of your
hypothesis be penalized in accordance with its added complexity
-</em></p>
<p><em>Let Three talk,</em> said Ravenclaw One.</p>
<p><em>Okay... look,</em> said Ravenclaw Three. <em>First of all,
we don't</em> know <em>that anyone can take over the Ministry just
with mind control. Maybe magical Britain is really an oligarchy and
you need enough military power to intimidate the family heads into
submission -</em></p>
<p><em>Imperius them too,</em> interjected Ravenclaw Two.</p>
<p><em>- and the oligarchs have Thief's Downfall in the entrances
to</em> their <em>homes -</em></p>
<p><em>Complexity penalty!</em> cried Ravenclaw Two. <em>More
epicycles!</em></p>
<p>- <em>oh, be reasonable,</em> said Ravenclaw Three. <em>We
haven't actually</em> seen <em>anyone taking over the Ministry with
a couple of well-placed Imperius curses. We don't</em> know
<em>that it can actually be done that easily.</em></p>
<p><em>But,</em> said Ravenclaw Two, <em>even taking that into
account... it really seems like there should've been</em> some
<em>other way. Ten years of failure, really? Using only
conventional terrorist tactics? That's just... not even</em>
trying.</p>
<p><em>Maybe Lord Voldemort did have more creative ideas,</em>
replied Ravenclaw Three, <em>but he didn't want to tip his hand
to</em> other <em>countries' governments, didn't want</em> them
<em>to know how vulnerable they were and install Thief's Downfall
in</em> their <em>Ministries. Not until he had Britain as a base
and enough servants to subvert</em> all <em>the other major
governments simultaneously.</em></p>
<p><em>You're assuming he wants to conquer the whole world,</em>
noted Ravenclaw Two.</p>
<p><em>Trelawney prophesized that he would be our equal,</em>
intoned Ravenclaw Three solemnly. <em>Therefore, he wanted to take
over the world.</em></p>
<p><em>And if he is your equal, and you do have to fight him
-</em></p>
<p>For an instant, Harry's mind tried to imagine the specter of two
<em>creative</em> wizards fighting an all-out-war against each
other.</p>
<p>Harry had noted all the Charms and Potions in his first-year
books that could be creatively used to kill people. He hadn't been
able to help himself. Literally. He'd <em>tried</em> to stop his
brain from doing it each time, but it was like looking at a fish
and trying to stop your brain from noticing it was a fish. What
someone could creatively do with seventh-year, or Auror-level, or
ancient lost magic such as Lord Voldemort had possessed... didn't
bear thinking about. A magically-superpowered creative-genius
psychopath wasn't a 'threat', it was an extinction event.</p>
<p>Then Harry shook his head, dismissing the gloomy line his
reasoning had been going down. The question was whether there was a
significant probability of facing anything so terrible as a Dark
Rationalist in the first place.</p>
<p><em>Prior odds that someone attempting an immortality ritual
would actually have it work...</em></p>
<p>Call it one to a thousand, at a generous overestimate; it was
not the case that roughly one wizard in a thousand survived their
death. Though, admittedly Harry didn't have data on how many had
attempted immortality rituals first.</p>
<p><em>What if the Dark Lord</em> is <em>as smart as us?</em> said
Ravenclaw Three. <em>You know, the way Trelawney prophesied him
being our</em> equal. <em>Then he would</em> make <em>his
immortality ritual work.</em> <em>P.S., don't forget that 'destroy
all but a remnant of the other' line.</em></p>
<p>Requiring that level of intelligence was an additional
burdensome detail; prior odds of a random population member being
that intelligent were low...</p>
<p>But Lord Voldemort wasn't a randomly selected wizard, he was one
particular wizard in the population who'd come to everyone's
attention. The puzzle of the Mark implied a certain minimum level
of intelligence, even if (hypothetically) the Dark Lord had taken
longer to think it through. Then again, in the Muggle world, all of
the extremely intelligent people Harry knew about from history had
<em>not</em> become evil dictators or terrorists. The closest thing
to that in the Muggle world was hedge-fund managers, and none of
<em>them</em> had tried to take over so much as a third-world
country, a point which put upper bounds on both their possible evil
and possible goodness.</p>
<p>There were hypotheses where the Dark Lord was smart and the
Order of the Phoenix <em>didn't</em> just instantly die, but those
hypotheses were more complicated and ought to get complexity
penalties. After the complexity penalties of the further excuses
were factored in, there would be a large likelihood ratio from the
hypotheses 'The Dark Lord is smart' versus 'The Dark Lord was
stupid' to the observation, 'The Dark Lord did not instantly win
the war'. That was probably worth a 10:1 likelihood ratio in favor
of the Dark Lord being stupid... but maybe not 100:1. You couldn't
actually say that 'The Dark Lord instantly wins' had a probability
of <em>more</em> than 99 percent, assuming the Dark Lord started
out smart; the sum over all possible excuses would be more than
.01.</p>
<p>And then there was the Prophecy... which might or might not have
<em>originally</em> included a line about how Lord Voldemort would
<em>immediately</em> die if he confronted the Potters. Which Albus
Dumbledore had then edited in Professor McGonagall's memory, in
order to lure Lord Voldemort to his doom. If there <em>was</em> no
such line, the Prophecy did sound <em>somewhat</em> more like
You-Know-Who and the Boy-Who-Lived were destined to have some later
confrontation. But in <em>that</em> case, it was less likely that
Dumbledore would've come up with a plausible-sounding excuse not to
take Harry to the Hall of Prophecy...</p>
<p>Harry was wondering if he could even <em>get</em> a Bayesian
calculation out of this. Of course, the point of a subjective
Bayesian calculation wasn't that, after you made up a bunch of
numbers, multiplying them out would give you an exactly right
answer. The real point was that the <em>process</em> of making up
numbers would force you to tally all the relevant facts and weigh
all the relative probabilities. Like realizing, as soon as you
actually <em>thought</em> about the probability of the Dark Mark
not-fading <em>if</em> You-Know-Who <em>was</em> dead, that the
probability wasn't low enough for the observation to count as
strong evidence. One version of the process was to tally hypotheses
and list out evidence, make up all the numbers, do the calculation,
and then throw out the final answer and go with your brain's gut
feeling <em>after</em> you'd forced it to really <em>weigh</em>
everything. The trouble was that the items of evidence weren't
conditionally independent, and there were multiple interacting
background facts of interest...</p>
<p>...well, <em>one</em> thing at least was certain.</p>
<p>If the calculation could be done at all, it was going to take a
piece of paper and a pencil.</p>
<p>In the fireplace at one side of the Headmaster's office, the
flames suddenly flared up, turning from orange to bright billious
green.</p>
<p>"Ah!" said Professor McGonagall into the uncomfortable
non-silence. "That would be Mad-Eye Moody, I suppose."</p>
<p>"Let this matter bide for now," the Headmaster said in some
relief, as he too turned to regard the Floo. "I believe we are
about to receive some news regarding it, as well."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><em>Hypothesis: Hermione Granger</em><br />
<em>(April 8th, 1992, 6:53pm)</em></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Meanwhile in the Great Hall of Hogwarts, as the students who
didn't have secret meetings with the Headmaster bustled about their
dinner around four huge tables -</p>
<p>"It's funny," Dean Thomas said thoughtfully. "I didn't believe
the General when he said that what we learned would change us
forever, and we'd never be able to return to a normal life
afterward. Once we knew. Once we saw what <em>he</em> could
see."</p>
<p>"I know!" said Seamus Finnigan. "I thought it was just a joke
too! Like, you know, everything else General Chaos ever said
ever."</p>
<p>"But now -" Dean said sadly. "We <em>can't</em> go back, can we?
It'd be like going back to a Muggle school after having been to
Hogwarts. We've just... we've just got to stay around each other.
That's all we can do, or we'll go crazy."</p>
<p>Seamus Finnigan, next to him, just nodded wordlessly and ate
another bite of veldbeest.</p>
<p>Around them, the conversation at the Gryffindor table continued.
It wasn't as <em>relentless</em> as it'd been yesterday, but now
and then the topic wandered back.</p>
<p>"Well, there must've been <em>some</em> sort of love triangle,"
said a second-year witch named Samantha Crowley (she never answered
when asked if there was any relation). "The question is, which ways
was it <em>going</em> before it all went wrong? Who was in love
with who - and whether or not that person loved them back - I don't
know <em>how</em> many possibilities there are -"</p>
<p>"Sixty-four," said Sarah Varyabil, a blossoming beauty who
probably should've been Sorted into Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff
instead. "No, wait, that's wrong. I mean, if nobody loved Malfoy
and Malfoy didn't love anyone then he wouldn't really be part of
the love triangle... this is going to take Arithmancy, could you
all wait two minutes?"</p>
<p>"<em>I,</em> for one, think it perfectly clear that Granger is
Potter's moirail, and that Potter was auspisticing between Malfoy
and Granger." The witch who'd spoken nodded with the
self-satisfaction of someone who has just precisely nailed down a
complicated issue.</p>
<p>"Those aren't even words," objected a young wizard. "You're just
making them up as you go."</p>
<p>"Sometimes you can't describe a thing using <em>real</em>
words."</p>
<p>"It's so <em>sad,</em>" said Sherice Ngaserin, who actually had
tears in her eyes. "They were just - they were just so
<em>obviously</em> meant to be together!"</p>
<p>"You mean Potter and Malfoy?" said a second-year named Colleen
Johnson. "I know - their families hated each other so much, there's
no way they <em>couldn't</em> fall in love -"</p>
<p>"No, I mean all three of them," said Sherice.</p>
<p>This produced a brief pause in the huddled conversation. Dean
Thomas was quietly choking on his lemonade, trying not to make any
sounds as it trickled out of his mouth and soaked into his
shirt.</p>
<p>"<em>Wow,</em>" said a dark-haired witch by the name of Nancy
Hua. "That's really... <em>sophisticated</em> of you, Sherice."</p>
<p>"Look, you all, we need to keep this realistic," said Eloise
Rosen, a tall witch who'd been General of an army and hence spoke
with an air of authority. "We <em>know</em> - because she kissed
him - that Granger was in love with Potter. So the only reason
she'd try to kill Malfoy is if she knew that she was losing Potter
to him. There's no need to make it all sound so complicated -
you're all acting like this is a play instead of real life!"</p>
<p>"But even if Granger was in love, it's still funny that she'd
just <em>snap</em> like that," said Chloe, whose black robes
combined with her night-black skin to make her look like a darkened
silhouette. "I don't know... I think maybe there's more to this
than just a romance novel gone wrong. I think maybe most people
haven't got any idea at all what's going on."</p>
<p>"<em>Yes! Thank you!</em> " burst out Dean Thomas. "Look - don't
you realize - like Harry Potter <em>told</em> us all - if you
didn't <em>predict</em> that something would happen, if it took you
completely by surprise, then what you believed about the world when
you <em>didn't</em> see it coming, isn't enough to explain..."
Dean's voice trailed off, as he saw that nobody was listening.
"It's <em>completely hopeless,</em> isn't it?"</p>
<p>"You hadn't figured that out yet?" said Lavender Brown, who was
sitting across the table from her two fellow former Chaotics.
"How'd you ever make Lieutenant?"</p>
<p>"Oh, you two be quiet!" Sherice snapped at them. "It's obvious
you both want the three of them for yourselves!"</p>
<p>"I mean it!" Chloe said. "What if what's <em>really</em> going
on is different from all the, you know, <em>normal</em> things that
all the <em>ordinary</em> people are talking about? What if
somebody - <em>made</em> Granger do what she did, just like Potter
was trying to tell everyone?"</p>
<p>"I think Chloe's right," said a foreign-looking boy wizard who
always introduced himself as 'Adrian Turnipseed', though his
parents had actually named him Mad Drongo. "I think this whole time
there's been..." Adrian lowered his voice ominously, "...a
<em>hidden hand</em>..." Adrian raised his voice again, "shaping
all that's happened. One person who's been behind
<em>everything,</em> from the beginning. And I don't mean Professor
Snape, either."</p>
<p>"You don't mean -" gasped Sarah.</p>
<p>"Yes," Adrian said. "The <em>real</em> one behind it all is -
<em>Tracey Davis!</em> "</p>
<p>"That's what I think too," Chloe said. "After all -" She glanced
around rapidly. "Ever since that thing with the bullies and the
ceiling - even the trees in the forests around Hogwarts look like
they're <em>shaking,</em> like they're <em>afraid -</em>"</p>
<p>Seamus Finnigan was frowning thoughtfully. "I think I see where
Harry gets his... <em>you know...</em> from," Seamus said, lowering
his voice so that only Lavender and Dean could hear.</p>
<p>"Oh, I totally know what you mean," Lavender said. She didn't
bother to lower her own voice. "It's a wonder he didn't crack and
just start killing everyone <em>ages</em> ago."</p>
<p>"Personally," Dean said, also in a quieter voice, "I'd say the
really scary part is - that could've been <em>us.</em>"</p>
<p>"Yeah," said Lavender. "It's a good thing <em>we're</em> all
perfectly sane now."</p>
<p>Dean and Seamus nodded solemnly.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><em>Hypothesis: G. L.<br />
<em>(April 8th, 1992, 8:08pm)</em></em></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The Floo-Fire of the Headmaster's office blazed a bright
pale-green, the fire concentrating in on itself into a spinning
emeraldine whirlwind, and then flared even brighter and spit a
human figure into the air -</p>
<p>There was a blur of motion as the resolving figure snapped up a
wand, smoothly spinning with the Floo's momentum like a ballet
dance step, so that his firing arc covered the entire 360-degree
arc of the room; and then just as abruptly, the figure stopped in
place.</p>
<p>In the first instant that Harry saw that man, before Harry even
took in the eye, he noticed the scars on the hands, the scars on
the face, like the man had been burned and cut over his entire
body; though only the man's hands and face were visible, of all his
flesh. The rest of the man's body was hidden, encased not in robes,
but in leather that looked more like armor than clothing; dark gray
leather, matching the man's mess of grayed hair.</p>
<p>The next thing that Harry's vision comprehended was the
brilliant blue eye occupying the right side of the man's face.</p>
<p>One part of Harry's mind realized that the person whom Professor
McGonagall had named 'Mad-Eye Moody' was the same as the one
Dumbledore had called 'Alastor', within the memory Dumbledore had
shown Harry; an image from before whatever event had scarred every
inch of the man's body and taken a chunk out of his nose -</p>
<p>And another part of his mind noticed the jolt of adrenaline.
Harry had drawn his wand in sheer reflex when the man had spun out
of the Floo like that, there'd been something about it that felt
like <em>ambush,</em> Harry's hand had already started to level his
wand for a <em>Somnium</em> before he'd managed to stop himself.
Even now the armored man was holding his wand level, not pointed at
any particular person but covering the whole room, and that wand
was already in perfect line with his eyes, like a soldier sighting
down a gun. There was danger in the man's stance and the set of his
boots, danger in the leather armor he wore and danger in that
brilliant blue eye.</p>
<p>When the scarred man spoke, addressing the Headmaster, his voice
was edged. "I suppose you think this room is secure?"</p>
<p>"There are only friends here," Dumbledore said.</p>
<p>The man's head jerked toward Harry. "That include
<em>him?</em> "</p>
<p>"If Harry Potter is not our friend," Dumbledore said gravely,
"then we are all certainly doomed; so we may as well assume that he
is."</p>
<p>The man's wand stayed level, not quite pointing at Harry. "Boy
almost drew on me just then."</p>
<p>"Er..." Harry said. He noticed that his hand was still tightly
holding the wand, and consciously relaxed his hand and dropped it
back to his side. "Sorry about that, you looked a bit...
combat-ready."</p>
<p>The scarred man's wand moved slightly away from where it had
almost pointed at Harry, though it didn't lower, and the man let
out a short bark of laughter. "Constant vigilance, eh, lad?" said
the man.</p>
<p>"It's not paranoia if they really are out to get you," Harry
recited the proverb.</p>
<p>The man turned fully toward Harry; and insofar as Harry could
read any expression on the scarred face, the man now looked
<em>interested</em>.</p>
<p>Dumbledore's eyes had regained some of the brilliant twinkle
that they'd had before the Azkaban breakout, a smile beneath his
silver mustache as though that smile had never left. "Harry, this
is Alastor Moody, called also Mad-Eye, who will command the Order
of the Phoenix after me - if anything should happen to me, that is.
Alastor, this is Harry Potter. I have every hope the two of you
shall get along <em>fantastically</em>."</p>
<p>"I've heard a good deal about you, boy," said Mad-Eye Moody. His
one dark natural eye stayed fixed on Harry, while the point of
brilliant blue spun frantically, seeming to rotate all the way
around within its socket. "Not all of it good. Heard they're
calling you the Dementor Spooker, in the Department."</p>
<p>After some consideration, Harry decided to reply with a knowing
smile.</p>
<p>"How'd you pull off that one, boy?" the man said softly. Now his
blue eye was fixed on Harry as well. "I had a little chat with one
of the Aurors who escorted the Dementor there from Azkaban. Beth
Martin said it came straight from the pit, and no-one gave it any
special instructions along the way. Of course, she could be
lying."</p>
<p>"There wasn't any sneaky trick to that one," Harry said. "I just
did it the hard way. Of course, I could also be lying."</p>
<p>Dumbledore was leaning back in his chair, chuckling in the
background, like he was just another device in the Headmaster's
Office and that was the sound he made.</p>
<p>The scarred man turned back to face the Headmaster, though his
wand stayed pointed low and in Harry's general direction. When he
spoke his voice was gruff and businesslike. "I have a lead on a
recent host of Voldie's. You're certain his shade is in Hogwarts
now?"</p>
<p>"Not <em>certain</em> -" Dumbledore began.</p>
<p>"Say <em>what?</em> " Harry interrupted. After having nearly
concluded that the Dark Lord didn't exist, it was a shock to hear
it being discussed that matter-of-factly.</p>
<p>"Voldie's host," Moody said shortly. "The one he possessed
before he took over Granger."</p>
<p>"If the tales speak true," Dumbledore said, "there is some
device of power which binds Voldemort's shade to this world; and by
that means he may bargain with a host for possession of their body,
conferring on them some portion of his power and his pride -"</p>
<p>"So the obvious question is who's gained too much power too
quickly," Moody said abruptly. "And it turns out that there's a
fellow who's gone and banished the Bandon Banshee, staked an entire
rogue vampire clan in Asia, tracked down the Wagga-Wagga Werewolf,
and exterminated a pack of ghouls using a tea-strainer.
<em>And</em> he's milking it for all it's worth; there's been talk
of the Order of Merlin. Seems to have turned into a charmer and a
politician, not just a powerful wizard."</p>
<p>"Dear me," murmured Dumbledore. "Are you certain that he is not
relying on his own skills?"</p>
<p>"Checked his grades," Moody said. "Record shows Gilderoy
Lockhart received a Troll in his Defense O.W.L.S., didn't bother
with the N.E.W.T. Just the sort of sucker to take the deal Voldie
was offering." The blue eye whirled crazily within its socket.
"Unless you remember Lockhart as a student, and think he had enough
potential to do all that by himself?"</p>
<p>"No," said Professor McGonagall. She frowned. "Not a chance, I
should say."</p>
<p>"I fear I must agree," Dumbledore said with an undertone of
pain. "Ah, Gilderoy, you poor fool..."</p>
<p>Moody's grin was more like a snarl. "Three in the morning work
for you, Albus? Lockhart should be at his home tonight."</p>
<p>Harry listened to this with increasing alarm, wondering if even
the <em>Ministry</em> had any rules about magistrates needing to
issue warrants - never mind the illegal vigilante organization
Harry now seemed to have joined. "Excuse me," Harry said. "What
<em>exactly</em> happens at three in the morning?"</p>
<p>There must have been something in Harry's voice that gave him
away, because the scarred man whirled on him. "You have a problem
with that, boy?"</p>
<p>Harry paused, trying to figure out how to phrase this to the
stranger -</p>
<p>"You want to take him down yourself?" pressed the scarred man.
"Get revenge for your parents, eh?"</p>
<p>"No," Harry said as politely he could. "Honestly - look, if we
knew for <em>certain</em> he was a willing host for You-Know-Who,
that's one thing, but if we're <em>not</em> sure and you're heading
off to kill him -"</p>
<p>"Kill?" Mad-Eye Moody snorted. "It's what's locked up in his
head," Moody tapped his forehead, "that we need from him, boy. If
we're lucky, Voldie can't wipe the sucker's memories as easy as in
his living days, and Lockhart will remember what the horcrux looked
like."</p>
<p>Harry mentally noted down the word <em>horcrux</em> for future
research, and said, "I'm just worried that someone innocent - what
sounds like a pretty decent person, if he <em>did</em> do all that
himself - might be about to get hurt."</p>
<p>"Aurors hurt people," the scarred man said shortly. "Bad people,
if you're lucky. Some days you won't be lucky, and that's all there
is to it. Just remember, Dark Wizards hurt a lot more people than
we do."</p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath. "Can you at least <em>try</em> not to
hurt this person, in case he's <em>not -</em>"</p>
<p>"What is a first-year doing in this room, Albus?" demanded the
scarred man, now whirling to face the Headmaster. "And don't tell
me it's for what he did when he was a baby."</p>
<p>"Harry Potter is not an ordinary first-year," the Headmaster
said quietly. "He has already accomplished feats impossible enough
to shock even me, Alastor. His is the only intellect in the Order
which might someday match that of Voldemort himself, as you or I
never could."</p>
<p>The scarred man leaned over the Headmaster's desk. "He's a
liability. Naive. Doesn't know a bloody thing about what war's
like. I want him out of here and all his memories of the Order
wiped before one of Voldie's servants plucks them straight out of
his mind -"</p>
<p>"I'm an Occlumens, actually."</p>
<p>Mad-Eye Moody directed a narrow look at the Headmaster, who
nodded.</p>
<p>And then the scarred man turned to face Harry, their gazes
meeting.</p>
<p>The sudden fury of the Legilimency attack almost made Harry fall
off his chair, as a blade of white-hot steel cut into the imaginary
person at the forefront of his mind. Harry hadn't had a chance to
practice since Mr. Bester's training, and Harry very nearly lost
his grip on the imaginary person the back-of-his-mind was
pretending to be, as that person's world turned into searing lava
and a furious probe of questions. Harry almost lost his grip on
only <em>pretending</em> to hallucinate, only <em>pretending</em>
to be the imaginary person that was screaming in shock and pain as
the Legilimency tore apart his sanity and reshaped him to believe
that he was on fire -</p>
<p>Harry managed to break eye contact, dropping his eyes to Moody's
chin.</p>
<p>"You're out of practice, boy," Moody said. Harry wasn't looking
at the man's face, but his voice was deadly grim. "And I'll warn
you of this but once. Voldie isn't like any other Legilimens in
recorded history. He doesn't need to look you in the eyes, and if
your shields are that rusty he'd creep in so softly you'd never
notice a thing."</p>
<p>"Duly noted," Harry said to the scarred chin. Harry was more
shaken than he'd have admitted; Mr. Bester hadn't been anywhere
near that powerful, and had never tested Harry like <em>that</em>.
Pretending to be someone hurting that much had... Harry couldn't
find words for describing what it felt like to contain an imaginary
person in that much pain, but it hadn't been <em>normal</em>. "Do I
get any credit for being an Occlumens in the first place?"</p>
<p>"So you're think you're all grown up already, eh? Look me in the
eyes!"</p>
<p>Harry strengthened his shields, and looked once more into the
dark grey eye and the brilliant blue.</p>
<p>"Ever watched someone die?" asked Mad-Eye Moody.</p>
<p>"My parents," Harry said evenly. "I recovered the memory in
January when I went in front of a Dementor to learn the Patronus
Charm. I remember You-Know-Who's voice -" A chill went through
Harry's body, his wand twitching in his hand. "My main tactical
report is that You-Know-Who could speak the Killing Curse in less
than half a second, but you probably already knew that."</p>
<p>There was a gasp from Professor McGonagall's direction, and
Severus's face had tightened.</p>
<p>"All right," Mad-Eye Moody said softly. A strange, thin grin
twisted up the lips within the scarred face. "I'll make you the
same offer I'd make to any trainee Auror. Land one touch on me, boy
- one hit, one spell - and I'll concede your right to talk back to
me."</p>
<p>"Alastor!" exclaimed Professor McGonagall's voice. "Surely
that's an unreasonable test! Mr. Potter, whatever his other merits,
does not have a hundred years of fighting experience!"</p>
<p>Harry's eyes made a lightning dart around the room, passing over
the peculiar devices, glancing past Dumbledore and Severus and the
Sorting Hat, settling briefly here and there. Harry couldn't see
Professor McGonagall from where he was, but that didn't matter.
There was only one device he'd really wanted to look at, and the
point of all the other glances had just been to conceal which
one.</p>
<p>"All righty," Harry said, and hopped off his chair, ignoring
Professor McGonagall's inhalation and the Potions Master's snort of
disbelief. Dumbledore's eyebrows had lifted, and Moody was grinning
like a tiger. "Be sure to wake me up in forty minutes if he does
get me." Harry settled into a duelist's starting stance, his wand
held low. "Let's go, then -"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry opened his eyes, his head feeling like it had been stuffed
with cotton wool.</p>
<p>Everyone else was gone from the Headmaster's office, the
Floo-Fire dimmed; only Dumbledore still waited behind the desk.</p>
<p>"Hello, Harry," the Headmaster said quietly.</p>
<p>"I didn't even see him <em>move,</em>" Harry marvelled, muscles
creaking as he sat up.</p>
<p>"You were standing two paces away from Alastor Moody," said
Dumbledore, "and you took your eye off his wand."</p>
<p>Harry nodded, as he took the Cloak of Invisibility out of his
pouch. "I mean - I was taking the dueling stance so that he'd think
I was a standard idiot and underestimate me - but I have to admit,
<em>that</em> was impressive."</p>
<p>"So you planned it all along, Harry?" Dumbledore said.</p>
<p>"Of course," Harry said. "Note how I'm doing this as soon as I
wake up, rather than pausing to think of it."</p>
<p>Harry drew the hood of the Cloak over his head, and glanced back
up at the wall clock he'd surreptitiously glanced at earlier.</p>
<p>It had then shown around twenty-three minutes after eight, and
now it was five minutes after nine.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Minerva stared as the boy put himself into the dueling stance,
his wand held low. For a second Minerva wondered if Harry might
possibly - no, that was completely ridiculous, it was <em>Mad-Eye
Moody</em> and that was beyond impossible. Of course that was what
she'd thought about his partial Transfiguration, too...</p>
<p>"Let's go, then," Harry said and fell over.</p>
<p>Severus gave a single chuckle. "Mr. Potter has his points, I
must confess," the Potions Master said. "Though I would never say
it while he was awake, and if you repeat the words I shall deny
them, for the boy's ego is quite large enough already. Mr. Potter
does have his points, Mad-Eye, but duelling is not among them."</p>
<p>Mad-Eye's own chuckle was lower and grimmer. "Oh, yes," said
Mad-Eye. "Only fools duel. Standing like that and waiting for me to
attack, what <em>was</em> the boy thinking? Why, I ought to give
him a scar, to remember this occasion -"</p>
<p>"Alastor!" barked Albus, just as she cried "Stop!", Severus
dashed forward, and Mad-Eye Moody deliberately leveled his wand on
Harry Potter's body.</p>
<p>"<em>Stupefy!</em> "</p>
<p>Mad-Eye's body seemed to almost flicker as he spun on his wooden
foot like lightning, faster than she'd ever seen anyone move
without magic, the red Stunning Hex passing through the suddenly
empty air and barely missing Severus to crash into the opposite
wall, and by the time her eyes jerked back to Moody there were
seventeen radiant orbs in the pattern of a <em>Sagitta Magica,</em>
visible for only an instant before they streaked brilliance and
struck <em>something</em> that fell to the floor with a thud -</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"Hello again, Harry," said Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"I cannot <em>believe</em> that guy's reaction time," Harry
said, brushing off his Cloak as he stood up from where he'd been
lying invisible on the floor, unseen by his previous self. "I can't
believe his movement speed either. I'm going to have to figure out
some way to zap him without speaking an incantation that gives it
away..."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>- and then Mad-Eye ducked hard and fast, his hands hitting flat
on the floor. She almost didn't see the two tiny white threads
passing through the space he'd been, but her eyes went to the blue
spark when the threads impacted on one of the Headmaster's devices,
and by the time she managed to turn her eyes back, Mad-Eye had spun
smoothly up to his feet, his wand was dancing unseeably fast and
there was another thudding sound -</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"Hello again, Harry."</p>
<p>"Pardon me, Headmaster, but could you let me go down your
stairs, and then come back up again, before I make the final jump
backward? This is going to take longer than one hour of preparation
-"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Minerva gaped at Mad-Eye Moody, who hadn't lowered his wand in
the slightest; and Severus had a look on his face that was almost
like shock.</p>
<p>"Well, boy?" said Mad-Eye Moody. "What else have you got?"</p>
<p>Harry Potter's head appeared, floating in midair as an invisible
hand drew back the hood of his invisibility cloak.</p>
<p>"That eye," said Harry Potter. There was a strange fierce light
in the boy's eyes. "That isn't any ordinary device. It can see
right through my invisibility cloak. You dodged my Transfigured
taser as soon as I started raising it, even though I didn't speak
any incantations. And now that I've watched it again - you spotted
all my Time-Turned selves the moment you Flooed into this room,
didn't you?"</p>
<p>Mad-Eye Moody was smiling, the same teeth-bared grin she'd seen
him wear as they'd faced off against Voldemort himself. "Spend a
hundred years hunting Dark wizards, and you see everything," said
Moody. "I once arrested a young Japanese who tried a similar trick.
He found out the hard way that his shadow replica technique was no
match for this eye of mine."</p>
<p>"You see in all directions," Harry Potter said, that strange
fierce light still in his gaze. "No matter where that eye is
pointing, it sees everything around you."</p>
<p>Moody's tiger-grin grew wider. "There's no more of you in this
room, now," Mad-Eye said. "Think that's because you'll give up
after this time, or because you'll win? Any bets, boy?"</p>
<p>"It's my final attempt because I decided to stake my last three
hours on one shot," said Harry Potter. "As for whether I win -"</p>
<p>There was a blur filling the whole air of the Headmaster's
office. Mad-Eye Moody leapt to one side with blinding speed and an
instant later Harry's head darted backward as he cried
"<em>Stuporfy!</em> "</p>
<p>Three shimmers in the air went past Harry's moving head, just as
a red bolt erupted from Harry's location, shooting past Moody as he
dodged in yet another direction -</p>
<p>If she'd blinked, she would have missed it, the red bolt making
an angled turn in midair and slamming into Moody's ear.</p>
<p>Moody fell.</p>
<p>Harry Potter's floating head dropped to the height of a
first-year on their hands and knees, then dropped further to the
ground, his face showing sudden exhaustion.</p>
<p>Minerva McGonagall said, "What in <em>Merlin's name</em> just
-"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"So you went to Flitwick, then," Moody said. The retired Auror
was now sitting in a chair, drinking long draughts from a
restorative in a bottle he'd taken off his belt.</p>
<p>Harry Potter nodded, now sitting in his own chair instead of
perched on an armrest. "I tried the Defense Professor first, but -"
The boy grimaced. "He... wasn't available. Well, I'd decided it was
worth risking five House points, and if you say a risk is worth it,
you can't complain when you have to pay up. Anyway, I figured that
if you had an eye that saw things other people couldn't see, then
as Isaac Asimov pointed out in <em>Second Foundation</em>, the
weapon to use is a brilliant light. Read enough science fiction,
you know, and you'll read everything at least once. Anyway, I told
Professor Flitwick that I needed a Charm that would make a huge
number of shapes, bright and flickering and filling the whole
office, but invisible, so only your eye could see them. I had no
idea what it would even <em>mean</em> to cast an illusion and then
make it invisible, but I figured if I didn't mention that out loud,
Professor Flitwick would just do it anyway, and he did. Turns out
there was no spell like that I could cast myself, but Flitwick
Charmed me a one-time device for it - though I had to persuade him
that it wasn't cheating, since nothing could <em>possibly</em> be
cheating against an Auror who'd lived long enough to retire. And
then I still didn't see how I could hit you, when you were moving
that fast. So I asked about targeted spells, and that was when
Flitwick showed me that hex I cast at the end, the Swerving
Stunner. It's one of Professor Flitwick's own inventions - he's a
champion duellist as well as a Charms Master -"</p>
<p>"I know that, son."</p>
<p>"Sorry. Anyway, the Professor says he left the duelling circuit
before he got a chance to use that spell, since it only works as a
finishing move on an unshielded opponent. The hex gets as close to
the target as possible along its original trajectory, and then once
it detects that the target is getting more distant again, the hex
turns in midair and heads straight for the target. It can only
swerve once - but the incantation sounds very close to 'Stupefy'
and the hex is the same red color, so if the enemy thinks it's a
regular Stunning Hex and tries a normal dodge, that midair
retargeting will finish them off. Oh, and the Professor requested
that none of us talk about his special move, just in case he does
get a chance to use it during competition someday."</p>
<p>"But -" said Professor McGonagall. She glanced at Mad-Eye Moody,
who was nodding his approval, and at Severus, who was keeping his
face decidedly blank. "Mr. Potter, you just stunned <em>Mad-Eye
Moody!</em> The most famous Dark wizard hunter in the history of
the Auror Office! That should've been impossible!"</p>
<p>Moody let out a dark chuckle. "What's <em>your</em> answer to
that one, kid? I'm curious."</p>
<p>"Well..." Harry said. "First of all, Professor McGonagall,
neither of us were fighting seriously."</p>
<p><em>"Neither of you?"</em></p>
<p>"Of course," Harry said. "In a serious fight, Mr. Moody would've
dropped all my copies immediately without waiting for them to
attack. And on my side, if it was <em>actually</em> necessary to
take down the most famous Auror in the history of the office, I'd
get Headmaster Dumbledore to do it for me. And beyond that... since
that <em>wasn't</em> a real fight..." Harry paused. "How can I put
this? Wizards are used to duels where people fight back and forth
with spells for a while. But if two Muggles with guns stand in a
small room and fire bullets at each other... then whoever hits
first, wins. And if one of them is deliberately missing his shots,
giving the other person one chance after another - like Mr. Moody
gave me one chance after another - well, you'd have to be pretty
pathetic to lose."</p>
<p>"Oh, not <em>that</em> pathetic," Moody said with a slightly
threatening grin.</p>
<p>Harry didn't seem to notice. "You might say that Mr. Moody was
testing me to see if I would try to <em>fight</em> him, or try to
<em>win.</em> That is, whether I'd carry out the <em>role</em> of
somebody fighting - use standard spells I already knew, even though
I didn't expect the <em>consequences</em> of that action to be
victory - or if I'd search through unusual plans until I found
something that <em>could</em> win. Like the difference between a
student who sits in class because that's what students do, versus a
student who cares enough to ask themselves what it takes to
<em>actually</em> learn a piece of material, and practices however
necessary - you see, Professor McGonagall? When you look at it that
way - realize that Mr. Moody was giving me chances, and that I
shouldn't attack in the first place unless I think I can win - then
I don't come out looking so well, since it actually took me three
tries to get him. Plus, like I said, in a real fight Mr. Moody
could've turned <em>himself</em> invisible, or put up shields
-"</p>
<p>"Don't go relying too much on shields, boy," Mad-Eye said. The
leather-clad Auror took another sip from his restorative flask.
"What you learn in your first year at the academy doesn't stay true
forever, not against the strongest Dark Wizards. Every shield ever
made, there's some curse that goes straight through it, if you're
not quick enough to cast the counter. And there's one curse that
goes through everything, and it's a curse any Death Eater will
use."</p>
<p>Harry Potter nodded gravely. "Right, some spells are impossible
to block. I'll remember that, in case anyone casts the Killing
Curse at me. Again."</p>
<p>"That kind of cleverness gets people killed, boy, and don't you
forget it."</p>
<p>A sad-sounding sigh from the Boy-Who-Lived. "I know. Sorry."</p>
<p>"So, son. You had something to say about when Albus and I go
after Lockhart?"</p>
<p>Harry opened his mouth, then paused. "I won't tell you how to
run a war," the Boy-Who-Lived said eventually. "I don't have any
experience at that. All I know is that there are consequences.
Please be advised that my own assessment is that Lockhart is
probably innocent, so if you can avoid hurting him without too much
risk -" The boy shrugged. "I don't know the cost. Just please, if
you can, be careful not to hurt him if he's innocent."</p>
<p>"If I can," said Moody.</p>
<p>"And - you're aiming to look through his mind for evidence about
the Dark Lord, aren't you? I don't know what the rules are in
magical Britain about admissible evidence - but everyone's always
guilty of breaking <em>some</em> law or another, there's just too
many laws. So if it's <em>not</em> about the Dark Lord, don't turn
him in to the Ministry, just Obliviate him and go, okay?"</p>
<p>Moody frowned. "Son, nobody gains power that fast without being
up to <em>something.</em>"</p>
<p>"Then leave it for the ordinary Aurors, if and when they find
evidence the ordinary way. Please, Mr. Moody. Call it a quirk of my
Muggle upbringing, but if it's <em>not</em> about the war I don't
want us to be the evil police who break into people's houses in the
middle of the night, rummage through their minds and send them off
to Azkaban."</p>
<p>"I don't see the sense of it, son, but I suppose I could do you
the favor."</p>
<p>"Is there aught else, Alastor?" inquired Albus.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Moody. "About that Defense Professor of yours -"</p>
<p><em>Hypothesis: Gilderoy Lockhart: END</em></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><em>Hypothesis: Dumbledore</em><br />
<em>(April 9th, 1992, 5:32pm)</em></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>As Professor Quirrell slowly raised up his tea, the teacup
jerked in midair, sending the dark translucent liquid just barely
slopping over the side, so that only three single drops crawled
down the side of the teacup. Harry would have missed it, if he
hadn't happened to be watching closely; for Professor Quirrell's
hand was perfectly steady on the cup before and after.</p>
<p>If that small jerky motion advanced to a constant tremor, it
would be the end of any non-wandless magic for the Defense
Professor. Wandwork had no room for trembling fingers. How much
that would <em>actually</em> handicap Professor Quirrell, if at
all, Harry couldn't guess. The Defense Professor was certainly
capable of wandless magic, yet still tended to use a wand for
larger things - but for him that might only be a convenience...</p>
<p>"Insanity," said Professor Quirrell, as he carefully sipped from
his tea - he was looking at the teacup, not at Harry, which was
unusual for him - "can be a signature all its own."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor's small office was silent, the
sound-warded room quiet in a way the Headmaster's office never
could be. Sometimes the two of them both happened to finish
exhaling or inhaling at the same time; and then there was an
auditory emptiness that was almost a sound in itself.</p>
<p>"I'll agree with that in one sense," Harry said. "If somebody
tells me that everyone is <em>staring</em> at them and that their
underwear is being dusted with thought-controlling powder, I know
they're psychotic, because that's the standard signature of
psychosis. But if you tell me that <em>anything</em> confusing
points to Albus Dumbledore as a suspect, that seems...
overreaching. Just because I can't see a purpose doesn't mean there
<em>is</em> no purpose."</p>
<p>"Purposeless?" said Professor Quirrell. "Oh, but the madness of
Dumbledore is not that he is purposeless, but that he has too many
purposes. The Headmaster might have planned this to make Lucius
Malfoy throw away his game for vengeance on you - or it might be a
dozen other plots. Who knows what the Headmaster thinks he has
reason to do, when he has found reason to do so many strange things
already?"</p>
<p>Harry had politely declined tea, even knowing that Professor
Quirrell would know what it meant. He'd considered bringing his own
can of soda - but had decided against that as well, after realizing
how easy it would be for the Defense Professor to teleport in a bit
of potion, even if the two of them couldn't touch each other with
direct magic.</p>
<p>"I have seen a little now of Dumbledore," Harry said. "Unless
everything I have seen is a lie, I find it difficult to believe
that he would plot to send any Hogwarts student to Azkaban.
Ever."</p>
<p>"Ah," the Defense Professor said softly, the tiny reflection of
the teacup gleaming in his pale eyes. "But perhaps that is another
signature, Mr. Potter. You have not yet comprehended the
perspective of a man like Dumbledore. If he must, in some
sufficiently noble cause, sacrifice a student - why, who would he
choose, but she who declared herself a heroine?"</p>
<p>That gave Harry some pause. It might just be hindsight bias, but
that <em>did</em> seem to concentrate some of that hypotheses's
probability mass onto framing Hermione in particular. Similarly,
Professor Quirrell <em>had</em> predicted in advance that
Dumbledore might target Draco...</p>
<p><em>But if it's you behind all of this, Professor, you might
have shaped your plans to frame the Headmaster, and taken care to
cast suspicion on him in advance.</em></p>
<p>The concept of 'evidence' had something of a different meaning,
when you were dealing with someone who had declared themselves to
play the game at 'one level higher than you'.</p>
<p>"I see your point, Professor," Harry said evenly, giving no hint
of his other thoughts. "So you think it most probable that it was
the Headmaster who framed Hermione?"</p>
<p>"Not necessarily, Mr. Potter." Professor Quirrell drained his
teacup in one swallow and then set it down, the cup making a sharp
rap as it descended. "There is also Severus Snape - though what he
might think to gain from this, I could not guess. Thus he is not my
prime suspect either."</p>
<p>"Then who is?" Harry said, somewhat puzzled. Professor Quirrell
surely wasn't about to reply 'You-Know-Who' -</p>
<p>"The Aurors have a rule," said Professor Quirrell. "Investigate
the victim. Many would-be criminals imagine that if they are the
apparent victims of a crime, they shall not be suspected. So many
criminals imagine it, indeed, that every senior Auror has seen it a
dozen times over."</p>
<p>"You're not seriously trying to convince me that
<em>Hermione</em> -"</p>
<p>The Defense Professor was giving Harry one of those slit-eyed
<em>looks</em> that meant he was being stupid.</p>
<p><em>Draco?</em> Draco had been interrogated under Veritaserum -
but Lucius might have had enough control to subvert Aurors to...
oh.</p>
<p>"You think <em>Lucius Malfoy</em> set up <em>his own son?</em> "
Harry said.</p>
<p>"Why not?" Professor Quirrell said softly. "From Mr. Malfoy's
recorded testimony, Mr. Potter, I gather that you enjoyed some
success in changing Mr. Malfoy's political views. If Lucius Malfoy
learned of that earlier... he might have decided that his
<em>former</em> heir had become a liability."</p>
<p>"I don't buy it," Harry said flatly.</p>
<p>"You are being wantonly naive, Mr. Potter. The history books are
full of family disputes turned murderous, for inconveniences and
threats far less than those which Mr. Malfoy posed to his father. I
suppose next you will tell me that Lord Malfoy of the Death Eaters
is far too gentle to wish his son such harm." A tinge of heavy
sarcasm.</p>
<p>"Well, yes, frankly," Harry said. "Love is real, Professor, a
phenomenon with observable effects. Brains are real, emotions are
real, and love is as much a part of the real world as apples and
trees. If you made experimental predictions without taking parental
love into account, you'd have a heck of a time explaining why my
own parents didn't abandon me at an orphanage after the Incident
with the Science Project."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor did not react to this at all.</p>
<p>Harry continued. "From what Draco says, Lucius prioritized him
over important Wizengamot votes. That's significant evidence, since
there's less expensive ways to fake love, if you just want to fake
it. And it's not like the prior probability of a parent loving
their child is <em>low</em>. I suppose it's possible that Lucius
was just taking on the <em>role</em> of a loving father, and he
renounced that role after he learned Draco was consorting with
Muggleborns. But as the saying goes, Professor, one must
distinguish possibility from probability."</p>
<p>"All the better the crime," the Defense Professor said, still in
that soft tone, "if no one would believe it of him."</p>
<p>"And how would Lucius even Memory-Charm Hermione in the first
place, without setting off the wards? <em>He's</em> not a Professor
- oh, right, you think it's Professor Snape."</p>
<p>"Wrong," said the Defense Professor. "Lucius Malfoy would trust
no servant with that mission. But suppose some Hogwarts Professor,
intelligent enough to cast a well-formed Memory Charm but of no
great fighting ability, is visiting Hogsmeade. From a dark alley
the black-clad form of Malfoy steps forth - he would go in person,
for this - and speaks to her a single word."</p>
<p>"<em>Imperio</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>Legilimens,</em> rather," said Professor Quirrell. "I do
not know if the Hogwarts wards would trigger for a returning
Professor under the Imperius Curse. And if I do not know, Malfoy
probably does not know either. But Malfoy is a perfect Occlumens at
least; he might be able to use Legilimency. And for the
target...perhaps Aurora Sinistra; none would question the Astronomy
Professor moving about at night."</p>
<p>"Or even more obviously, Professor Sprout," said Harry. "Since
she's the last person anyone would suspect."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor hesitated minutely. "Perhaps."</p>
<p>"Actually," Harry said then, putting a thoughtful frown on his
face, "I don't suppose you know offhand if any of the current
Professors at Hogwarts were around back when Mr. Hagrid got framed
in 1943?"</p>
<p>"Dumbledore taught Transfiguration, Kettleburn taught Magical
Creatures, and Vector taught Arithmancy," Professor Quirrell said
at once. "And I believe that Bathsheda Babbling, now of Ancient
Runes, was then a Ravenclaw prefect. But Mr. Potter, there is no
reason to suppose that anyone besides You-Know-Who was involved in
<em>that</em> affair."</p>
<p>Harry shrugged artfully. "Seemed worth asking the question, just
to check. Anyway, Professor, I agree it's possible that some
outsider Legilimized a member of Hogwarts staff - and then
Obliviated them afterward, there's no way anyone would forget that
part. But I <em>don't</em> think Lucius Malfoy is a probable
candidate for the mastermind. It's possible but not probable that
all of Lucius's apparent love for Draco was just a sense of duty,
and that it all went up in a puff of smoke. It's possible though
not probable that everything Lucius did in front of the Wizengamot
was just an act. People's outsides do not always resemble their
insides, like you said. But there's one piece of evidence that
doesn't fit at all."</p>
<p>"And that would be?" said the Defense Professor, his eyes
half-lidded.</p>
<p>"Lucius tried to reject a hundred thousand Galleons for
Hermione's life. I saw how surprised the Wizengamot was, when
Lucius said he was refusing it despite the rules of honor. The
Wizengamot didn't <em>expect</em> that of him. Why
<em>wouldn't</em> he just take the money while acting all indignant
and pretending to grit his teeth? He wouldn't actually care that
much about throwing Hermione into Azkaban."</p>
<p>There was a pause. "Perhaps the role he was playing ran away
with him," said Professor Quirrell. "It does happen, Mr. Potter, in
the heat of the moment."</p>
<p>"Perhaps," Harry said. "But it's still one more
<em>improbability</em> to be postulated - and by the time you have
to add up that many excuses in a theory, it can't be at the top of
the list anymore. Anything else in particular you think I ought to
think about, within the range of all other possibilities?"</p>
<p>There was a long silence. The Defense Professor's eyes dropped
down to look at the empty teacup before them, seeming unusually
distant.</p>
<p>"I suppose I can think of one final suspect," the Defense
Professor said at last.</p>
<p>Harry nodded.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor didn't seem to notice, but only spoke on.
"Has the Headmaster has told you anything - even a hint - about
Professor Trelawney's prophecy?"</p>
<p>"<em>Huh?</em> " Harry said automatically, converting his own
sudden shock into the best dissembling he could manage. It probably
was at the wrong level to fool Professor Quirrell but Harry
<em>certainly</em> couldn't take time to think before replying -
<em>wait, but how on Earth would Professor Quirrell know about</em>
that <em>-</em> "Professor Trelawney made a prophecy?"</p>
<p>"You <em>were</em> there to hear its beginning," Professor
Quirrell said, frowning. "You called out to the entire school that
the prophecy could not be about you, since you were not coming
here, you were already here."</p>
<p><em>HE IS COMING. THE ONE WHO WILL TEAR APART THE VERY
-</em></p>
<p>And that was as far as Professor Trelawney had gotten before
Dumbledore had grabbed her and vanished.</p>
<p>"Oh, <em>that</em> prophecy," Harry said. "Sorry! It went clear
out of my mind."</p>
<p>Harry thought he'd put too much force into the end statement,
and was 80%-expecting Professor Quirrell to say, <em>Aha, now Mr.
Potter, what is this mysterious</em> other <em>prophecy you went to
such lengths to deny -</em></p>
<p>"That is foolish," the Defense Professor said sharply, "if
indeed you are telling me the truth. Prophecies are not trivial
things. I have racked my brain much over the little that I heard,
but such a small fragment is simply too little."</p>
<p>"You think the one who's coming is the one who might've framed
Hermione?" said Harry. As his mind allocated yet another
hypothesis, <em>uncertain predicate referent,
he-who-is-coming.</em></p>
<p>"With no offense meant to Miss Granger," the Defense Professor
said with another frown, "her life or death does not seem that
important. But someone <em>was</em> to come - one who, in your
interpretation, was not already there - and someone so significant,
and unknown as a player... who knows what <em>else</em> they may
have done?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded, and mentally sighed because he was going to have
to redo his Lord-Voldemort odds calculation with yet another piece
of evidence in the mix.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell spoke with eyes half-lidded, looking out like
through slits. "More than the question of whom the prophecy spoke -
who was meant to <em>hear</em> it? It is said that fates are spoken
to those with the power to cause them or avert them. Dumbledore.
Myself. You. As a distant fourth, Severus Snape. But of those four,
Dumbledore and Snape would often be in Trelawney's presence. You
and I are the ones who would not have spent much time around her
before that Sunday. I think it quite likely that the prophecy was
meant for one of <em>us</em> - before Dumbledore took the
prophetess away. <em>Did</em> the Headmaster say nothing more to
you?" Professor Quirrell's voice was demanding now. "I thought I
heard too much force in that denial, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>"Honestly, no," Harry said. "It had honestly slipped clear out
of my mind."</p>
<p>"Then I am rather put out with him," Professor Quirrell said
softly. "In fact, I think that I am angry."</p>
<p>Harry said nothing. He didn't even sweat. It might've been a
poor reason for confidence, but on this particular score, Harry did
happen to be innocent.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell nodded once, sharply, as though in
acknowledgment. "If there is nothing more to say between us, Mr.
Potter, you may go."</p>
<p>"I can think of one <em>other</em> suspect," Harry said.
"Someone you didn't put on your list at all. Would you analyze him
to me, Professor?"</p>
<p>There was another of those moments of silence that was almost a
sound in itself.</p>
<p>"As for <em>that</em> suspect," the Defense Professor said
softly, "I think you shall prosecute him on your own, Mr. Potter,
without help from me. I have heard such requests before, and
experience leads me to refuse. Either I will do too good a job of
prosecuting myself, and convince you that I am guilty - or else you
will decide that my prosecution was too half-hearted, and that I am
guilty. I will remark only this in my defense - that I would have
needed a very good reason indeed to jeopardize your fragile
alliance with the heir to House Malfoy."</p>

<p><em>Hypothesis: The Defense Professor</em><br />
<em>(April 8th, 1992, 8:37pm)</em></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"...so I fear I must take my leave," Dumbledore was saying
gravely. "I promised Quirinus... that is to say, I promised the
Defense Professor... that I would not make any attempt to uncover
his true identity, in my own person or any other."</p>
<p>"And why'd you make a fool promise like that, then?" snapped
Mad-Eye Moody.</p>
<p>"It was an unalterable condition of his employment, or so he
said." Dumbledore glanced at Professor McGonagall, a wry smile
briefly flitting over his face. "And Minerva made it clear to me
that Hogwarts <em>required</em> a competent Defense Professor this
year, even if I had to haul Grindelwald out of Nurmengard and
prevail on old affections to persuade him to take the
position."</p>
<p>"I did not <em>quite</em> phrase it in that fashion -"</p>
<p>"Your expression said it for you, my dear."</p>
<p>And so soon the four of them - Harry, Professor McGonagall, the
Potions Master, and Alastor Moody aka 'Mad-Eye' - were ensconced
all by themselves in the Headmaster's office.</p>
<p>It was strange how the Headmaster's office seemed...
<em>unbalanced...</em> without the Headmaster in it. If you didn't
have the ancient wizened master to make it all seem
<em>solemn</em>, you were just four people trying to have a serious
meeting while surrounded by bizarre, noisy gidgets. Clearly visible
from where Harry had perched himself on his chair's arm was a
truncated-conical object, like a cone with its top snipped off,
slowly spinning around a pulsating central light which it shaded
but did not obscure; and each time the inner light pulsated, the
assembly made a <em>vroop-vroop-vroop</em> sound that sounded oddly
distant, muffled like it was coming from behind four solid walls,
even though the spinning-conical-section thingy was only a meter or
two away.</p>
<p><em>Vroop... vroop... vroop</em>...</p>
<p>And then there were the various still-breathing bodies of Harry
Potter he'd stashed in one quiet corner, cleaning up a mess that
was his own in more ways than one. (Only one body <em>wasn't</em>
inside a copy of the Invisibility Cloak; but then it merely took a
small effort of concentration for Harry to perceive his other
selves beneath the Cloak of which he was master - an effort which
Harry had carefully <em>not</em> put forth earlier, to avoid
getting advance temporal information he wanted to determine by his
own decision.) The sad thing was that by this point, having his own
body visibly lying in a corner didn't seem all that crazy. It was
just... Hogwarts.</p>
<p>"All right, then," Moody said, looking rather sour about it.
From within his leather armor, the scarred man took out a black
folder. "This is a copy of what Amelia's people put together. She
almost certainly knows we've got it, but it's all off the books,
that clear? Anyway -"</p>
<p>And Moody told them who the Department of Magical Law
Enforcement thought 'Quirinus Quirrell' really was. A seemingly
ordinary Hogwarts student (though talented enough that he'd been
only narrowly beaten out for the Head Boy position) who'd gone
vacationing in Albania after his graduation, disappeared, returned
after 25 years, and then been caught up in the Wizarding War -</p>
<p>"It was murdering the House of Monroe that made Voldie's name,"
Moody said. "Until then, he was just another Dark Wizard with
delusions of grandeur and Bellatrix Black. But after that -" Moody
snorted. "Every fool in the country flocked to serve him. You
would've <em>hoped</em> the Wizengamot would turn serious, once
they realized Voldie was willing to kill their own sacred selves.
And that's just what the bastards did - <em>hope</em> that some
other bastard would turn serious. None of the cowards wanted to
step in front. It was Monroe, Crouch, Bones, and Longbottom. That
was nearly everyone in the Ministry who'd dare say a word that
might give Voldie offense."</p>
<p>"That was how your House came to be ennobled, Mr. Potter,"
injected the solemn voice of Professor McGonagall. "There is an
ancient law that if anyone ends a Most Ancient House, whoever
avenges that blood will be made Noble. To be sure, the House of
Potter was already older than some lines called Ancient. But yours
was titled a Noble House of Britain after the end of the war, in
recognition that you had avenged the Most Ancient House of
Monroe."</p>
<p>"Flush of gratitude and all that," Mad-Eye Moody said sourly.
"It didn't last, but at least James and Lily got a fancy title and
a useless medal to take to their graves. But that's leaving out
eight years of complete horror after Monroe disappeared and Regulus
Black - he was Monroe's private source in the Death Eaters, we're
pretty sure - was executed by Voldie. Like a dam breaking and gore
flooding out, drowning the whole country. Albus bloody Dumbledore
himself had to step into Monroe's shoes, and that was barely enough
for us to survive."</p>
<p>Harry listened with an odd sense of unreality. Some of it
<em>felt</em> right, matched up with observation - especially with
the speech Professor Quirrell had made before Christmas - and
yet...</p>
<p>This was <em>Professor Quirrell</em> they were talking
about.</p>
<p>"So that's who the Department thinks is your Defense Professor,"
Mad-Eye Moody finished up his account. "Now what do <em>you</em>
think, son?"</p>
<p>"Well..." Harry said slowly. <em>It is also possible to have a
mask behind the mask.</em> "The obvious next thought is that this
'David Monroe' person died in the war after all, and this is just
someone else pretending to be David Monroe pretending to be
Quirinus Quirrell."</p>
<p>"That's <em>obvious?</em> " said Professor McGonagall. "Dear
Merlin..."</p>
<p>"Really, boy?" said Mad-Eye Moody, his blue eye spinning
rapidly. "I'd say that's a little... <em>paranoid.</em>"</p>
<p><em>You don't know Professor Quirrell,</em> Harry did not say.
"It's an easy theory to test," Harry said out loud. "Just check
whether the Defense Professor remembers something about the war
that the real David Monroe would've known. Though I suppose, if
he's playing the part of David Monroe <em>pretending</em> to be
someone else, he has a good excuse to <em>pretend</em> he's
pretending he doesn't know what you're talking about -"</p>
<p>"A <em>little</em> paranoid," said the scarred man, his voice
rising. "<em>Not paranoid enough! CONSTANT VIGILANCE!</em> Think
about it, lad - what if the <em>real</em> David Monroe never came
back from Albania?"</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"I see..." Harry said.</p>
<p>"Of course you do," Professor McGonagall said. "Don't mind me,
please. I'll just sit here quietly going mad."</p>
<p>"In this line of work, if you survive, you learn that there's
three kinds of Dark Wizards," Moody said grimly; his wand wasn't
pointed at anyone, it was angled slightly downward, but it was in
his hand. It had never left his hand since the moment he'd entered
the room. "There's Dark Wizards that have one name. There's Dark
Wizards that have two names. And there's Dark Wizards that change
names like you and I change clothes. I saw 'Monroe' go through
three Death Eaters like he was snapping twigs. There's not many
wizards that good at age forty-five. Dumbledore, maybe, but not
many others."</p>
<p>"Perhaps that is true," said the Potions Master from where he
was lurking. "But what of it, Mad-Eye? Whatever his identity,
Monroe was surely the Dark Lord's enemy. I've heard Death Eaters
curse his name even after they thought him dead. They feared him
well."</p>
<p>"So far as Defense Professors are concerned," Professor
McGonagall said primly, "I shall take it and be grateful."</p>
<p>Moody swung around to glare at her. "Just where the devil was
'Monroe' all those years he was gone, eh? Maybe he thought he could
make a name for himself in Britain by opposing Voldie, and vanished
away when he found out he was wrong. Then why'd he come back
<em>now,</em> hah? What's his <em>new</em> plan?"</p>
<p>"He, ah..." Harry ventured tentatively. "He <em>says</em> he
always wanted to be a great Defense Professor because all the best
fighting wizards have taught at Hogwarts. And he kind of
<em>is</em> being an incredibly good Defense Professor, actually...
I mean, if he just wanted to keep up a disguise, he could get away
with <em>much</em> sloppier work..."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall was nodding firmly.</p>
<p>"Naive," Moody said flatly. "I suppose you all haven't wondered
if your Defense Professor set up the whole House of Monroe to be
wiped out?"</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " cried Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>"Our mystery wizard hears about a missing kid from a Most
Ancient House of Britain," Moody said. "Steps into the shoes of
'David Monroe', but stays away from the real Monroe family. But
eventually the House is bound to notice something wrong. So this
imposter somehow prods Voldie into wiping them all out - maybe
leaked a password they'd given him for their wards - and then he
was a Lord of the Wizengamot!"</p>
<p>There seemed to be a fight going on inside Harry's mind between
Hufflepuff One, who'd never trusted the Defense Professor in the
first place; and Hufflepuff Two, who was far too loyal to Harry's
friend, Professor Quirrell, to believe something like that just
because Moody said so.</p>
<p><em>It</em> is <em>kind of obvious, though,</em> observed his
Slytherin part. <em>I mean, do you actually believe that under
natural circumstances, anyone would end up as the last heir to a
Most Ancient House AND Lord Voldemort killed his family AND he has
to avenge his martial arts sensei? If anything I'd say he went too
far over the top in setting up his new identity as the ideal
literary hero. That sort of thing doesn't happen in real
life.</em></p>
<p><em>This from an orphan who was raised unaware of his
heritage,</em> commented Harry's Inner Critic. <em>With a prophecy
about him. You know, I don't think we've ever read a story about
two equally destined heroes competing to see who's cliched enough
to take down the villain -</em></p>
<p><em>Yes,</em> replied the central Harry over the distant
vroop-ing noise in the background, <em>it's a very sad life we lead
and YOU'RE NOT HELPING.</em></p>
<p><em>There's only one thing to do at this point,</em> said
Ravenclaw. <em>And we all know what it is, so why argue?</em></p>
<p><em>But,</em> Harry replied, <em>how</em> do <em>we test
experimentally whether or not Professor Quirrell is the original
David Monroe? I mean, what sort of observable behaves differently,
depending on whether he's the real David Monroe or an
impostor?</em></p>
<p>"What do you want me to do about it, Mad-Eye?" Professor
McGonagall was demanding. "I can't -"</p>
<p>"You can," the scarred man said, glaring at her fiercely. "Just
fire the bloody Defense Professor."</p>
<p>"You say that <em>every</em> year," said Professor
McGonagall.</p>
<p>"Yes, and I'm always right!"</p>
<p>"Constant vigilance or no, Alastor, the students must be
taught!"</p>
<p>Moody snorted. "Pfah! I swear the curse gets worse every year,
as you lot get more and more reluctant to let them go. Your
precious Professor Quirrell would have to <em>be</em> Grindelwald
in disguise, to get himself sent off!"</p>
<p>"Is he?" Harry couldn't help asking. "I mean, could he
<em>actually</em> be -"</p>
<p>"I check Grindie's cell every two months," Moody said. "He was
there in March."</p>
<p>"Could the person in the cell be a ringer?"</p>
<p>"I administer a blood test for his identity, son."</p>
<p>"Where do you keep the blood you use as a reference?"</p>
<p>"In a safe place." Something like a smile was stretching the
scarred lips. "Have you considered the Auror Office after you
graduate?"</p>
<p>"Alastor," Professor McGonagall said reluctantly. "The Defense
Professor <em>does</em> have a... health condition. I suppose you
will call it suspicious in itself - but it is by no means certain
that it will be any ill-doing on his part which prevents us from
renewing his employment."</p>
<p>"Yes, his little naptimes," Moody said darkly. "Amelia thinks he
stepped into the path of a high-level curse. Sounds to <em>me</em>
more like a Dark ritual gone wrong!"</p>
<p>"You've no proof of that!" Professor McGonagall said.</p>
<p>"That man might as well be wearing a sign saying 'Dark Wizard'
in glowing green letters over his head."</p>
<p>"Ah..." Harry said. It didn't seem like an especially good time
to ask what Mr. Moody thought of the 'not all sacrificial rituals
are evil' standpoint. "Excuse me, but you said earlier that
Professor Quirrell - I mean the old David Monroe - I mean the
Monroe from the seventies - anyway, you said that person used the
Killing Curse. What does that imply? Does somebody have to be a
Dark Wizard to use it?"</p>
<p>Moody shook his head. "I've used it myself. All it takes is
power and a certain <em>mood.</em>" The grimacing lips were showing
teeth. "The first time I cast it was against a wizard named Gerald
Grice, and you can ask me what <em>he</em> did after you graduate
Hogwarts."</p>
<p>"But why is it Unforgiveable, then?" Harry said. "I mean, a
Cutting Hex can kill someone too. So why's it any better to use a
Reducto instead of Avada Kedav-"</p>
<p>"Shut your mouth!" Moody said sharply. "Someone might take it
the wrong way, your saying that incantation. You <em>look</em> too
young to cast it, but there's such a thing as Polyjuice. And to
answer your question, boy, there's two reasons why that spell's in
the blackest book. The first is that the Killing Curse strikes
directly at the soul, and it'll just keep going until it hits one.
Straight through shields. Straight through <em>walls.</em> There's
a <em>reason</em> why even Aurors fighting Death Eaters weren't
allowed to use it before the Monroe Act."</p>
<p>"Ah," said Harry. "That does seem like an excellent reason to
ban -"</p>
<p>"I'm not finished, son. The second reason is that the Killing
Curse doesn't <em>just</em> take a powerful bit of magic. You've
got to <em>mean</em> it. You've got to <em>want</em> someone dead,
and not for the greater good, either. Killing Grice didn't bring
back Blair Roche, or Nathan Rehfuss, or David Capito. It wasn't for
justice, or to stop him doing it again. <em>I wanted him dead.</em>
You understand now, lad? You don't have to be a Dark Wizard to use
that spell - but you can't be Albus Dumbledore, either. And if
you're arrested for killing with it, there's no possible
defense."</p>
<p>"I... see," murmured the Boy-Who-Lived. <em>You can't want the
person dead as an instrumental value on the way to some positive
future consequence, you can't cast it if you believe it's a
necessary evil, you have to actually want them dead for the sake of
being dead, as a terminal value in your utility function.</em> "A
magically embodied preference for death over life, striking within
the plane of pure life force... that does sound like a difficult
spell to block."</p>
<p>"Not difficult," Moody snapped. "<em>Impossible</em>."</p>
<p>Harry nodded gravely. "But David Monroe - or whoever - used the
Killing Curse against a couple of Death Eaters even <em>before</em>
they wiped out his family. Does that mean he already had to hate
them? Like, the martial arts story was probably true?"</p>
<p>Moody shook his head slightly. "One of the dark truths of the
Killing Curse, son, is that once you've cast it the first time, it
doesn't take much hate to do it again."</p>
<p>"It damages the mind?"</p>
<p>Again Moody shook his head. "No. It's the killing that does
that. Murder tears the soul - but that's just the same if it's a
Cutting Hex. The Killing Curse doesn't crack your soul. It just
takes a cracked soul to cast." If there was a sad expression on the
scarred face, it could not be read. "But that doesn't tell us much
about Monroe. The ones like Dumbledore who'll never be able to cast
the Curse all their lives, because they never crack no matter what
- they're the rare ones, very rare. It only takes a little
cracking."</p>
<p>There was a strange heavy feeling in Harry's chest. He'd
wondered what exactly it had meant, that Lily Potter had tried to
cast the Killing Curse at Lord Voldemort with her last breath. But
surely it was forgiveable, it was <em>right</em> and
<em>proper</em> for a mother to hate the Dark Wizard who was coming
to kill her baby, mocking her for how she couldn't stop him. There
was something wrong with you as a parent if you <em>couldn't</em>
cast Avada Kedavra, in that situation. And no other spell could've
gone past the Dark Lord's shields; you'd have to at least
<em>try</em> to hate the Dark Lord enough to want him dead for the
sake of dead, if that was the only way to save your baby.</p>
<p><em>It only takes a little cracking...</em></p>
<p>"Enough," said Professor McGonagall. "What would you have us
do?"</p>
<p>Moody's smile twisted. "Get rid of the Defense Professor and see
if all your troubles mysteriously clear up. Bet you a Galleon they
do."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall looked like she was in pain. "Alastor - but
- will <em>you</em> teach the classes, if -"</p>
<p>"Ha!" said Moody. "If I ever say yes to that question, check me
for Polyjuice, because it's not me."</p>
<p>"I'll test it experimentally," Harry said. And then, as everyone
looked at him, "I'll ask Professor Quirrell a question that the
real David Monroe would know - like who else was in the Slytherin
class of 1945, or something like that - hopefully without making it
obvious. It won't be definitive proof, he could've studied the
role, but it would be evidence. Still, Mr. Moody, even if Professor
Quirrell isn't the original Monroe, I'm not sure that getting rid
of him is a free action. He saved my life twice -"</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " demanded Moody. "When? How?"</p>
<p>"Once when he knocked down a bunch of witches who were summoning
me toward the ground, once when he figured out that the Dementor
was draining me through my wand. And if Professor Quirrell
<em>wasn't</em> the one who set up Draco Malfoy in the first place,
then he saved Draco Malfoy's life, and things would be a lot worse
if he hadn't. If the Defense Professor <em>isn't</em> behind it all
- he's not someone we can afford to just get rid of."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall nodded firmly.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><em>Hypothesis: Severus Snape</em><em><br /></em><em>(April 8th,
1992, 9:03pm)</em></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry and Professor McGonagall now stood on the slowly turning
stairs, turning without descending; or at least <em>one</em> Harry
stood upon those stairs - his other three selves had been left
behind in the Headmaster's office.</p>
<p>"Can I ask you a private question?" Harry said, when he thought
they were far enough away not to be heard. "And in particular,
private from the Headmaster."</p>
<p>"Yes," Professor McGonagall said, not quite sighing. "Though I
hope you realize that I cannot <em>do</em> anything which conflicts
with my duties to -"</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said, "that's exactly what I need to ask you about.
In front of the Wizengamot, when Lucius Malfoy was saying that
Hermione was no part of House Potter and that he wouldn't take the
money, you told Hermione how to swear that oath. I want to know, if
something like that comes up again, if your first duty is to the
Hogwarts student Hermione Granger, or to the head of the Order of
the Phoenix, Albus Dumbledore."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall looked like someone had hit her in the face
with a cast-iron frying-pan, a few minutes earlier, and now she'd
been told that somebody was about to do it again, and not to
flinch.</p>
<p>Harry flinched a little himself. Somewhere along the line he
needed to pick up the knack of <em>not</em> phrasing things to hit
as hard as he possibly could.</p>
<p>The walls rotated around them, behind them, and somehow, they
descended.</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr. Potter," Professor McGonagall said with a low
exhalation. "I... <em>wish</em> you wouldn't ask me such
questions... oh, Harry, I wasn't thinking then, not at all. I only
saw a chance to help Miss Granger and... I <em>was</em> Sorted into
Gryffindor, after all."</p>
<p>"You've got a chance to think now," Harry said. It was all
coming out wrong, but he had to say it <em>anyway,</em> because -
"I'm not asking you to be loyal to <em>me.</em> But if you do know
- if you <em>are</em> sure - what you'll do if it comes down to an
innocent Hogwarts student versus the Order of the Phoenix a second
time..."</p>
<p>But Professor McGonagall shook her head. "I'm <em>not</em>
sure," the Transfiguration Professor whispered. "I don't know if it
was the right choice even then. I'm sorry. I can't decide such
awful things!"</p>
<p>"But you'll do <em>something</em> if it happens again," Harry
said. "Indecision is also a choice. You can't just <em>imagine</em>
having to make an immediate decision?"</p>
<p>"No," Professor McGonagall said, sounding a little stronger; and
Harry realized that he'd accidentally offered a way out. The
Professor's next words confirmed Harry's fears. "Such a dreadful
choice as that, Mr. Potter - I think I should not make it until I
must."</p>
<p>Harry gave an internal sigh. He supposed he had no right to
expect Professor McGonagall to say anything else. In a moral
dilemma where you lost something either way, making the choice
would <em>feel</em> bad either way, so you could temporarily save
yourself a little mental pain by refusing to decide. At the cost of
not being able to plan anything in advance, and at the cost of
incurring a huge bias toward inaction or waiting until too late...
but you couldn't expect a witch to know all that. "All right,"
Harry said.</p>
<p>Though it wasn't right at all, not really. Dumbledore might want
that debt removed, Professor Quirrell would also want Harry out of
that debt. And if the Defense Professor <em>was</em> David Monroe,
or could convincingly <em>appear</em> to be David Monroe, then Lord
Voldemort technically hadn't <em>exterminated</em> the House of
Monroe. In which case somebody might be able to pass a Wizengamot
resolution revoking the Noble status of House Potter, which had
been granted for avenging the Most Ancient House of Monroe.</p>
<p>In which case Hermione's vow of service to a Noble House might
be null and void.</p>
<p>Or maybe not. Harry didn't know anything about the legalities,
especially not whether House Potter got the money <em>back</em> if
someone managed to send Hermione to Azkaban. Just because you lost
something might not mean the payment was returned, legally
speaking. Harry wasn't sure and he didn't dare ask a magical
solicitor...</p>
<p>...it would have been nice to be able to trust at least one
adult to take Hermione's side instead of Dumbledore's, if an issue
like that threatened to come up.</p>
<p>The stairs they were upon ceased rotating, and they were before
the backs of the great stone gargoyles, which rumbled aside,
revealing the hallway.</p>
<p>Harry stepped out -</p>
<p>A hand caught at Harry's shoulder.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," Professor McGonagall said in a low voice, "why did
you to tell me to keep watch over Professor Snape?"</p>
<p>Harry turned around again.</p>
<p>"You told me to keep watch, and see if he'd changed," Professor
McGonagall went on, her tone urgent. "<em>Why</em> did you say
that, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>It took a moment, at this point, for Harry to think back and
remember why he <em>had</em> said that. Harry and Neville had
rescued Lesath Lestrange from bullies, and then Harry had
confronted Severus in the hallway and, at least according to the
Potions Master's own words, 'almost died' -</p>
<p>"I learned something that made me worry," Harry said after a
moment. "From someone who made me promise not to tell anyone else."
Severus had made Harry swear that their conversations wouldn't be
shared with anyone, and Harry was still bound by it.</p>
<p>"<em>Mr.</em> Potter -" began Professor McGonagall, and then
exhaled, the flash of sharpness disappearing as quickly as it had
come. "Never mind. If you cannot say, you cannot say."</p>
<p>"Why do <em>you</em> ask?" Harry said.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall seemed to hesitate -</p>
<p>"All right, let me be more specific," Harry said. After
Professor Quirrell had done it to <em>him</em> several times, Harry
was starting to get the hang of it. "What change have you
<em>already</em> observed in Professor Snape that you're trying to
decide whether to tell me about?"</p>
<p>"Harry -" the Transfiguration Professor said, and then closed
her mouth.</p>
<p>"I obviously know <em>something</em> you don't," Harry said
helpfully. "See, this is why we can't always put off trying to
decide our awful moral dilemmas."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall closed her eyes, drew in a deep breath,
pinched the bridge of her nose and squeezed it several times. "All
right," she said. "It's a subtle thing... but worrying. How can I
put this... Mr. Potter, have you read many books that young
children are not meant to read?"</p>
<p>"I've read <em>all</em> of them."</p>
<p>"Of course you have. Well... I don't quite understand it myself,
but for so long as Severus has been employed in this school,
stalking about in that awful stained cloak, there has been a
<em>certain sort of girl</em> that stares at him with longing eyes
-"</p>
<p>"You say that like it's a bad thing?" Harry said. "I mean, if
there's one thing I <em>did</em> understand from those books, it's
that you're not supposed to question people's preferences."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall gave Harry a <em>very</em> strange
look.</p>
<p>"I mean," Harry said again, "from what I've read, when I'm a bit
older there's something like a 10% chance that <em>I'll</em> find
Professor Snape attractive, and the important thing is for me to
just accept whatever I -"</p>
<p>"<em>In any case, Mr. Potter,</em> Severus has always been
entirely indifferent to the stares of those young girls. But now -"
Professor McGonagall seemed to realize something, and hastily said,
her hands rising in warding, "Please don't mistake me, Professor
Snape <em>certainly</em> has not taken advantage of any young
witches! Absolutely not! He has never even so much as smiled at
one, not that I ever heard. He has told the young girls to stop
gaping at him. And if they stare at him regardless, he looks away.
That I have seen with my own eyes."</p>
<p>"Er..." Harry said. "Sorry, but just because I've <em>read</em>
those books doesn't mean I understood them. What does all that
<em>mean?</em> "</p>
<p>"That he is <em>noticing</em>," Professor McGonagall said in a
low voice. "It is a subtle thing, but now that I have seen it, I am
certain. And <em>that</em> means... I am very much afraid... that
the bond which held Severus to Albus's cause... may have weakened,
or even broken."</p>
<p>2 + 2 = ...</p>
<p><em>"Snape and Dumbledore?</em> " Then Harry heard the words
that had just come out of his mouth, and hastily added, "Not that
there's anything wrong with that -"</p>
<p><em>"No!"</em> said Professor McGonagall. "Oh, for pity's sake -
I can't explain it to you, Mr. Potter!"</p>
<p>The other shoe finally dropped.</p>
<p><em>He was</em> still <em>in love with my mother?</em></p>
<p>This seemed somewhere between beautifully sad, and pathetic, for
around five seconds before the <em>third</em> shoe dropped.</p>
<p><em>Of course, that was before I gave him my helpful
relationship advice.</em></p>
<p>"I see," Harry said carefully after a few moments. There were
times when saying 'Oops' didn't fully cover it. "You're right,
that's not a good sign."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall put both hands over her face. "Whatever
you're thinking right now," she said in a slightly muffled voice,
"which I assure you is <em>also</em> wrong, I don't want to hear
about it, ever."</p>
<p>"So..." Harry said. "If, like you said, the bond that held
Professor Snape to the Headmaster <em>has</em> broken... what would
he do then?"</p>
<p>There was a long silence.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><em>What would he do then?</em></p>
<p>Minerva lowered her hands, gazing down at the upturned face of
the Boy-Who-Lived. One simple question shouldn't have caused her so
much dismay. She'd known Severus for years; the two of them bound,
in some strange way, by the prophecy they'd both heard. Though
Minerva suspected, from what she knew of the rules of prophecy,
that she had only <em>overheard</em> it herself. It had been
Severus's acts which had brought about the prophecy's fulfillment.
And the guilt, the heartbreak which had come of that choice, had
been tormenting the Potions Master for years. She couldn't imagine
who Severus would be without it. Her mind went blank, trying to
imagine; her thoughts an empty parchment.</p>
<p><em>Surely</em> Severus was no longer the man he'd once been,
that angry and terribly foolish young man who'd brought the
prophecy before Voldemort in exchange for being admitted into the
Death Eaters. She'd known him for years, and surely Severus was no
longer that man...</p>
<p>Did she really know him at all?</p>
<p>Had <em>anyone</em> ever seen the real Severus Snape?</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"I don't know," Professor McGonagall finally said. "I truly
don't know at all. I can't even imagine. Do <em>you</em> know
anything of this, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>"Er..." Harry said. "I think I can say that my own evidence
points in the same direction as yours. I mean, it increases the
probability that Professor Snape isn't in love with my mother
anymore."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall closed her eyes. "I give up."</p>
<p>"I don't know of anything wrong he's done apart from that,
though," Harry added. "I assume the Headmaster cleared you to ask
me about this?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall looked away from him, staring at the wall.
"Please don't, Harry."</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said, and turned and hurried out into the
hallways, hearing Professor McGonagall more slowly walking after,
and the rumbling sound of the gargoyles moving into place.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>It was the morning after next, during Potions class, that
Harry's <em>potion of cold resistance</em> boiled over his cauldron
with a green froth and mildly nauseating smell, and Professor
Snape, looking more resigned than disgusted, told Harry to stay
after class. Harry had his own suspicions about this affair, and as
soon as class let out - Hermione, as usual for the last few days,
being the first to flee out the door - the door swung shut and
locked behind the departing students.</p>
<p>"I apologize for ruining your potion, Mr. Potter," Severus Snape
said quietly. There was upon his face the strange sad look that
Harry had seen only once before, in a hallway some time ago. "It
will not be reflected in your grades. Please, sit down."</p>
<p>Harry sat back down at his desk, filling up the time by
scrubbing a bit more at the green stain on the wooden surface, as
the Potions Master incanted a few privacy spells.</p>
<p>When the Potions Master was done, he spoke again. "I... do not
know how to broach this topic, Mr. Potter, so I will simply say
it... before the Dementor, you recovered your memory of the night
your parents died?"</p>
<p>Harry silently nodded.</p>
<p>"If... I know it must not be a pleasant memory, but... if you
could tell me what happened...?"</p>
<p>"Why?" Harry said. His voice was solemn, definitely <em>not
mocking</em> the pleading look that Harry had never expected to see
from that person. "I wouldn't think that would be a pleasant thing
for you to hear either, Professor -"</p>
<p>The Potions Master's voice was almost a whisper. "I have
imagined it every night these last ten years."</p>
<p><em>You know,</em> said Harry's Slytherin side, <em>it might not
be such a good idea to give him closure, if his guilt-based
loyalties are already wavering -</em></p>
<p><em>Shut up. Overruled.</em></p>
<p>It wasn't something that Harry could <em>actually</em> bring
himself to deny. He took one suggestion from his Slytherin side,
and that was it.</p>
<p>"Will you tell me <em>exactly</em> how you came to learn about
the Prophecy?" Harry said. "I'm sorry to make this a trade, I
<em>will</em> tell you afterward, only, it could be really
important -"</p>
<p>"There is little to say. I had come to be interviewed by the
Deputy Headmistress for the position of Potions Master, and so I
was waiting outside the room of the Hog's Head Inn when the
applicant before me, Sybill Trelawney, came to seek the position of
Professor of Divination. As soon as Trelawney finished speaking her
words, I fled, forsaking my chance at Hogwarts's Mastery, and went
to the Dark Lord." The Potions Master's face was drawn and tight.
"I did not even pause to consider why that riddle might have come
to me, before I sold it to another."</p>
<p>"A <em>job interview?</em> " Harry said. "Where you and
Professor Trelawney both happened to be applying, and Professor
McGonagall was interviewing? That seems... like rather a large
coincidence..."</p>
<p>"Seers are the pawns of time, Mr. Potter. Coincidence is beneath
them, and they are above it. I was the one meant to hear that
prophecy and become its fool. Minerva's presence made no final
difference to how it came about. There was no Memory Charm as you
supposed, I do not know why you thought that, but there was no
Memory-Charm, there could have been no Memory-Charm. The voice of a
seer has a quality, an enigma which even Legilimency cannot share,
how could that be imbued in a false memory? Do you think the Dark
Lord would believe my mere words? The Dark Lord seized my mind and
saw the mystification there, even if he could not seize the
mystery, and so he knew the prophecy had been true. The Dark Lord
could have killed me then, having taken what he wanted - I was a
fool indeed to go to him - but he saw something in me I do not
know, and took me into the Death Eaters, though on his terms rather
than mine. That is how I brought it about, brought it all about,
from beginning to end, always my own doing." Severus's voice had
gone rather hoarse, and his face was filled with naked pain. "Now
tell me, please, how did Lily die?"</p>
<p>Harry swallowed twice, and began his recounting.</p>
<p>"James Potter shouted for Lily to run away with me, that he
would hold off You-Know-Who."</p>
<p>"You-Know-Who said -" Harry stopped, the chills going all over
his own skin, his own muscles tightening as if in preparing for a
seizure. The memory was returning strongly, now, accompanied by
cold and darkness in association. "He used... the Killing Curse...
and then he came upstairs somehow, I think he must have flown, I
don't remember any footsteps on stairs or anything like that... and
then my mother said, 'No, not Harry, please not Harry!' or
something like that. And the Dark Lord - his voice was so high,
like water whistling out of a teakettle only <em>cold</em> - the
Dark Lord said -"</p>
<p><em>Stand aside, woman! For you I am not come, only the
boy.</em></p>
<p>The words were very clear in Harry's memory.</p>
<p>"- he told my mother to get out of his way, that he was only
there for <em>me</em>, and my mother begged him to have mercy, and
the Dark Lord said -"</p>
<p><em>I give you this rare chance to flee.</em></p>
<p>"- that he was being generous and giving her a chance to run,
but he wouldn't bother fighting her, and even if she died, she
couldn't save me -" Harry's voice was unsteady, "- and so she ought
to get out of his way. And that was when my mother begged the Dark
Lord to take her life instead of mine - and the Dark Lord - the
Dark Lord said to her - and his voice was lower this time, like he
was dropping a pose -"</p>
<p><em>Very well, I accept the bargain.</em></p>
<p>"- he said that he accepted her offer, and that she should drop
her wand so he could kill her. And then the Dark Lord waited, just
waited. I, I don't know what Lily Potter was thinking, it hadn't
even made sense in the first place, what she said, it wasn't like
the Dark Lord would kill her and then just <em>leave,</em> when
he'd come there for me. Lily Potter didn't say anything, and then
the Dark Lord started laughing at her and it was horrible and - and
she finally tried the only thing left that wasn't abandoning me or
just giving up and dying. I don't know if she even could've, if the
spell would've worked for her, but when you think about, she had to
try. The last thing my mother said was 'Avada Ke-' but the Dark
Lord started his own curse as soon as she said 'Av' and he said it
in less than half a second and there was a flash of green light and
then - and then - <em>and then</em> -"</p>
<p>"That's enough."</p>
<p>Slowly, like a body floating to the surface of water, Harry
returned from wherever he'd been.</p>
<p>"That's enough," the Potions Master said hoarsely. "She died...
Lily died without pain, then? The Dark Lord... did not do anything
to her, before she died?"</p>
<p><em>She died thinking that she'd failed, and that the Dark Lord
was going to kill her baby next. That's pain.</em></p>
<p>"He - the Dark Lord didn't torture her -" Harry said. "If that's
what you're asking."</p>
<p>Behind Harry, the door unlocked itself and swung open.</p>
<p>Harry left.</p>
<p>It was Friday, April 10th, of 1992.</p>
