<div class='storycontent nocopy' id='storycontent'>
<p>Harry, holding the tea cup in the exactly correct way that
Professor Quirrell had needed to demonstrate three times, took a
small, careful sip. All the way across the long, wide table that
was the centerpiece of Mary's Room, Professor Quirrell took a sip
from his own cup, making it look far more natural and elegant. The
tea itself was something whose name Harry couldn't even pronounce,
or at least, every time Harry had tried to repeat the Chinese
words, Professor Quirrell had corrected him, until finally Harry
had given up.</p>
<p>Harry had maneuvered himself into getting a glimpse at the bill
last time, and Professor Quirrell had let him get away with it.</p>
<p>He'd felt an impulse to drink a Comed-Tea first.</p>
<p><em>Even taking that into account</em>, Harry had still been
shocked out of his skin.</p>
<p>And it still tasted to him like, well, tea.</p>
<p>There was a quiet, nagging suspicion in Harry's mind that
Professor Quirrell <em>knew</em> this, and was deliberately buying
ridiculously expensive tea that Harry couldn't appreciate <em>just
to mess with him.</em> Professor Quirrell <em>himself</em> might
not like it all that much. Maybe <em>nobody</em> actually liked
this tea, and the only point of it was to be ridiculously expensive
and make the victim feel unappreciative. In fact, maybe it was
really just ordinary tea, only you asked for it in a certain code,
and they put a fake gigantic price on the bill...</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's expression was drawn and thoughtful. "No,"
Professor Quirrell said, "you should <em>not</em> have told the
Headmaster about your conversation with Lord Malfoy. Please try to
think faster next time, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Professor Quirrell," Harry said meekly. "I still
don't see it." There were times when Harry felt very much like an
impostor, pretending to be cunning in Professor Quirrell's
presence.</p>
<p>"Lord Malfoy is Albus Dumbledore's opponent," said Professor
Quirrell. "At least for this present time. All Britain is their
chessboard, all wizards their pieces. Consider: Lord Malfoy
threatened to throw away everything, abandon his game, to take
vengeance on you if Mr. Malfoy was hurt. In which case, Mr.
Potter...?"</p>
<p>It took more long seconds for Harry to get it, but it was clear
that Professor Quirrell wasn't going to give any more hints, not
that Harry wanted them.</p>
<p>Then Harry's mind finally made the connection, and he frowned.
"Dumbledore kills Draco, makes it look like <em>I</em> did it, and
Lucius sacrifices his game against Dumbledore to get at me? That...
doesn't seem like the Headmaster's <em>style,</em> Professor
Quirrell..." Harry's mind flashed back to a similar warning from
Draco, which had made Harry say the same thing.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell shrugged, and sipped his tea.</p>
<p>Harry sipped his own tea, and sat in silence. The tablecloth
spread over the table was in a very peaceful pattern, seeming at
first like plain cloth, but if you stared at it long enough, or
kept silent long enough, you started to see a faint tracery of
flowers glimmering on it; the curtains of the room had changed
their pattern to match, and seemed to shimmer as though in a silent
breeze. Professor Quirrell was in a contemplative mood that
Saturday, and so was Harry, and Mary's Room, it seemed, had not
neglected to notice this.</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell," Harry said suddenly, "is there an
afterlife?"</p>
<p>Harry had chosen the question carefully. Not, <em>do you believe
in an afterlife?</em> but simply <em>Is there an afterlife?</em>
What people <em>really</em> believed didn't seem to them like
<em>beliefs</em> at all. People didn't say, 'I strongly believe in
the sky being blue!' They just said, 'the sky is blue'. Your true
inner map of the world just felt to you like the way the world
<em>was...</em></p>
<p>The Defense Professor raised his cup to his lips again before
answering. His face was thoughtful. "If there is, Mr. Potter," said
Professor Quirrell, "then quite a few wizards have wasted a great
deal of effort in their searches for immortality."</p>
<p>"That's not actually an answer," Harry observed. He'd learned by
now to notice that sort of thing when talking to Professor
Quirrell.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell set down his teacup with a small,
high-pitched tacking sound on his saucer. "Some of those wizards
were reasonably intelligent, Mr. Potter, so you may take it that
the existence of an afterlife is not obvious. I have looked into
the matter myself. There have been many claims of the sort which
hope and fear would be expected to produce. Among those reports
whose veracity is not in doubt, there is nothing which could not be
the result of mere wizardry. There are certain devices said to
communicate with the dead, but these, I suspect, only project an
image from the mind; the result seems indistinguishable from memory
because it <em>is</em> memory. The alleged spirits tell no secrets
they knew in life, nor could have learned after death, which are
not known to the wielder -"</p>
<p>"Which is why the Resurrection Stone is not the most valuable
magical artifact in the world," said Harry.</p>
<p>"Precisely," said Professor Quirrell, "though I wouldn't say no
to a chance to try it." There was a dry, thin smile on his lips;
and something colder, more distant, in his eyes. "You spoke to
Dumbledore of that as well, I take it."</p>
<p>Harry nodded.</p>
<p>The curtains were taking on a faintly blue pattern, and a dim
tracery of elaborate snowflakes now seemed to be becoming visible
on the tablecloth. Professor Quirrell's voice sounded very calm.
"The Headmaster can be very persuasive, Mr. Potter. I hope he has
not persuaded you."</p>
<p>"<em>Heck</em> no," said Harry. "Didn't fool me for a
second."</p>
<p>"I should hope not," said Professor Quirrell, still in that very
calm tone. "I would be extremely put out to discover that the
Headmaster had convinced you to throw away your life on some fool
plot by telling you that death is the next great adventure."</p>
<p>"I don't think the Headmaster believed it himself, actually,"
Harry said. He sipped his own tea again. "He asked me what I could
possibly do with eternity, gave me the usual line about it being
boring, and he didn't seem to see any conflict between that and his
own claim to have an immortal soul. In fact, he gave me a whole
long lecture about how awful it was to want immortality before he
claimed to have an immortal soul. I can't quite visualize what must
have been going on inside his head, but I don't think he
<em>actually</em> had a mental model of himself continuing forever
in the afterlife..."</p>
<p>The temperature of the room seemed to be dropping.</p>
<p>"You perceive," said a voice like ice from the other end of the
table, "that Dumbledore does not truly believe as he speaks. It is
not that he has compromised his principles. It is that he never had
them from the beginning. Are you becoming cynical yet, Mr.
Potter?"</p>
<p>Harry had dropped his eyes to his teacup. "A little," Harry said
to his possibly-ultra-high-quality, perhaps-ridiculously-expensive
Chinese tea. "I'm certainly becoming a bit <em>frustrated</em>
with... whatever's going wrong in people's heads."</p>
<p>"Yes," said that icy voice. "I find it frustrating as well."</p>
<p>"Is there any way to get people <em>not</em> to do that?" said
Harry to his teacup.</p>
<p>"There is indeed a certain useful spell which solves the
problem."</p>
<p>Harry looked up hopefully at that, and saw a cold, cold smile on
the Defense Professor's face.</p>
<p>Then Harry got it. "I mean, <em>besides</em> Avada Kedavra."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor laughed. Harry didn't.</p>
<p>"Anyway," Harry said hastily, "I <em>did</em> think fast enough
not to suggest the obvious idea about the Resurrection Stone in
front of Dumbledore. Have you ever seen a stone with a line, inside
a circle, inside a triangle?"</p>
<p>The deathly chill seemed to draw back, fold into itself, as the
ordinary Professor Quirrell returned. "Not that I can recall,"
Professor Quirrell said after a while, a thoughtful frown on his
face. "That is the Resurrection Stone?"</p>
<p>Harry set aside his teacup, then drew on his saucer the symbol
he had seen on the inside of his cloak. And before Harry could take
out his own wand to cast the Hover Charm, the saucer went floating
obligingly across the table toward Professor Quirrell. Harry really
wanted to learn that wandless stuff, but that, apparently, was far
above his current curriculum.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell studied Harry's tea-saucer for a moment, then
shook his head; and a moment later, the saucer went floating back
to Harry.</p>
<p>Harry put his teacup back on the saucer, noting absently as he
did so that the symbol he'd drawn had vanished. "If you happen to
see a stone with that symbol," said Harry, "and it <em>does</em>
talk to the afterlife, do let me know. I have a few questions for
Merlin or anyone who was around in Atlantis."</p>
<p>"Quite," said Professor Quirrell. Then the Defense Professor
lifted up his teacup again, and tipped it back as though to finish
the last of what was there. "By the way, Mr. Potter, I fear we
shall have to cut short today's visit to Diagon Alley. I was hoping
it would - but never mind. Let it stand that there is something
else I must do this afternoon."</p>
<p>Harry nodded, and finished his own tea, then rose from his seat
at the same time as Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"One last question," Harry said, as Professor Quirrell's coat
lifted itself off the coatrack and went floating toward the Defense
Professor. "Magic is loose in the world, and I no longer trust my
guesses so much as I once did. So in your own best guess and
without any wishful thinking, do <em>you</em> believe there's an
afterlife?"</p>
<p>"If I did, Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell as he shrugged
on his coat, "would I still be <em>here?</em> "</p>
