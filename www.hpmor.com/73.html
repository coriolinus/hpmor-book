<div class='storycontent nocopy' id='storycontent'>
<p><em>The red jet of fire took Hannah full in the face, flipping
her end-over-heels and smacking her head straight into the stone
wall, where her pale face seemed to linger for an instant, framed
by flying strands of brown-golden hair, before she collapsed to the
ground in a heap of robes, as the third and final volley of blazing
green spirals brought down their foe's Shield Charm.</em></p>
<p>The March days marched by, filled with lectures and study and
homework, breakfast and lunch and dinner.</p>
<p><em>The Gryffindor boy stared at the eight of them, tension in
every line of his body's frame, his face working soundlessly; and
then his hands released their clenched grasp on the Slytherin boy's
lapels, and he walked away without anyone saying a word. (Well,
Lavender almost said a word - her mouth was just opening in
indignation, maybe because she hadn't gotten a chance to declaim
her speech - but luckily Hermione spotted it and made the gesture
that meant SHUT UP.)</em></p>
<p>Then there was sleeping, of course. You wouldn't want to forget
about sleeping just because it seemed so normal.</p>
<p><em>"Innervate!" said the young voice of Susan Bones, and
Hermione's eyes flew open and her lips drew in air with a gasp, her
lungs feeling heavy like there was a huge weight resting on her
chest. Beside her, Hannah was already sitting up, holding her head
in her hands and grimacing. Daphne had warned them that this would
be a 'hard' fight, creating a certain trepidation in Hermione, and
indeed in all of them. Except maybe Susan, who'd just shown up at
the appointed meeting-time, and walked alongside them without
speaking, and fought the seventh-year bully until she was the last
girl standing. Maybe the Gryffindor had been reluctant to fight the
last daughter of Bones, or maybe Susan had just gotten very lucky;
at any rate, when Hermione had tried to sit up again, she'd
realized that her chest had felt heavy because there was, in fact,
a rather large body sprawled on top of her.</em></p>
<p>And you wouldn't want to forget about magic either, even if the
actual moment of casting a spell only formed a very small part of
your day. It was the whole point of Hogwarts, after all.</p>
<p><em>"Okay, how about if we all ride around on skateboards?" said
Lavender. "We could get places faster than walking. And we'd look
really awesome on skateboards, Muggle artifacts may not be as fast
as broomsticks but they look cooler - we should vote on it
-"</em></p>
<p>As for the remaining fractions of time, you would fill that
according to your nature: gossip about upper-year romances, or
books and study sessions.</p>
<p><em>Hermione reached out a trembling hand to grasp her copy
of</em> Hogwarts: A History <em>from where it had fallen, the
ever-comforting book only a pace distant from where she herself had
ended up on the floor, after the red-robed upper-year girl had
"bumped" her into a wall. And then the older Gryffindor witch had
walked away without a look back, only a whispered "Salazar's -" and
a word that hurt her more than anything the Slytherins said about
mudbloods, 'mudblood' was just a strange wizarding word but
Hermione knew the word the Gryffindor had said. She couldn't get
used to it, she just couldn't get used to being hated. It still
hurt just as much every time it happened, and somehow it hurt even
more coming from the Gryffindors who were</em> supposed <em>to be
the good ones.</em></p>
<p>Harry had divided up eight of his soldiers among the other
armies, as ordered; he'd voluntarily given up <em>two</em> Chaotic
Lieutenants, sending Dean Thomas to Dragon Army and then trading
Seamus Finnigan to her for Blaise Zabini, who Harry had said was
being "underutilized" in Sunshine. Lavender had elected to join
most of SPHEW in Sunshine; Tracey had decided to stay with
Chaos.</p>
<p><em>"So you can work your charms on General Potter?" said
Lavender, as Hermione ignored both of them as hard as she could.
"I've got to say, Traces, I think our Sunshine General has him
pretty well sewn up by now - you'd have better luck convincing
Hermione that the three of you should have one of those, you know,
arrangements -"</em></p>
<p>Nobody had figured out yet what Draco Malfoy was plotting.</p>
<p><em>"Certain?" said Harry Potter, sounding rather reluctant.
"You know a rationalist isn't ever certain of anything, Hermione,
not even that two and two make four. I can't actually read Malfoy's
mind, and if I could, I couldn't be certain he wasn't a perfect
Occlumens. All I can say is that based on what I've seen of Malfoy,
it's a lot more plausible than Daphne Greengrass thinks, that he
actually is trying to show the Slytherins a better way. We
should... we really should try to go along with that,
Hermione."</em></p>
<p>(Well, Harry seemed to think Draco Malfoy was a good guy. But
then the trouble was that Harry also tended to trust people like
Professor Quirrell.)</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"Professor Quirrell," Harry said, "I'm worried about the hatred
Slytherin House seems to be developing for Hermione Granger."</p>
<p>They were sitting in the Defense Professor's office, Harry
sitting far back from the teacher's desk (and the sense of pending
disaster was still noticeable, even then), the empty bookcase still
framing Professor Quirrell's balding head. The cup balanced on
Harry's thigh was filled with Professor Quirrell's obscure,
probably-expensive Chinese tea, and it said something about the way
Harry had been thinking lately that he'd needed to make a conscious
decision to drink it.</p>
<p>"And this concerns me for what reason?" said Professor Quirrell,
sipping his tea.</p>
<p>"Yes, well," said Harry, "I'm just going to ignore that - oh,
stop that, Professor Quirrell, <em>you've</em> been plotting to
restore Slytherin House's reputation since at least the first
Friday of this year."</p>
<p>There might have been a tiny crack of a smile, at the edges of
those thin pale lips; and then again, there might not have been. "I
think Slytherin's House will do well enough in the end, Mr. Potter,
regardless of the fate of one girl. But I do agree that the present
outlook is not favorable for your little friend. The bullies of two
Houses, many of them with powerful and well-connected families, see
Miss Granger as a threat to their reputation and a shame to their
pride. As powerful a motive as that is to hurt her, it pales
compared to the raw envy of the Gryffindors, who see an outsider
gaining the laurels of heroism which they have dreamed of since
childhood." Now the smile on Professor Quirrell's lips was
definite, though slight. "And then there are those of Slytherin
House who hear that Salazar Slytherin's ghost has abandoned them to
favor a mudblood. I wonder if you can even conceive, Mr. Potter, of
how such as they would react? Those who do not believe it would
cheerfully kill Miss Granger for the insult. And as for those
Slytherins who wonder deep down, in some quiet place within
themselves, if it might perhaps be <em>true...</em> their inner
panic is something scarcely to be contemplated." Professor Quirrell
sipped his tea equably. "When you are more experienced, Mr. Potter,
you will see such consequences in advance of your plotting. As it
stands, you are being ill-served by your willful ignorance of all
human nature you deem unpleasant."</p>
<p>Harry sipped his own tea.</p>
<p>"Ah..." said Harry. "Professor Quirrell... help?"</p>
<p>"I already offered Miss Granger my help," said Professor
Quirrell, "as soon as I foresaw what would develop. My student told
me, in polite terms, to stay out of her business. Nor would she
tell you anything different, I expect. As I have little to truly
gain or lose in this matter, I hardly intend to press the point."
The Defense Professor shrugged, his teacup held steady in the
exactly-right polite grip, so that the surface of the liquid did
not even ripple as Professor Quirrell leaned back within his chair.
"Do not worry too much, Mr. Potter. Emotions run high around Miss
Granger, but she is in less danger than you might imagine. When you
are older, you will learn that the first and foremost thing which
any ordinary person does is nothing."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The envelope which the Slytherin System had delivered to Daphne
at lunch was unsigned, as always; the parchment within named a time
and a place and said, simply, <em>"Hard."</em></p>
<p>That wasn't what had concerned Daphne. What had concerned Daphne
was that Millicent didn't seem to be looking in her or Tracey's
direction at lunch that day. She'd just stared straight ahead at
her plate and eaten. Millicent had looked up just once that Daphne
saw, in the direction of the Hufflepuff table, and then looked
quickly back down again; though Daphne was too far away to see the
expression on Millicent's face, since Millicent had sat down far
away from her and Tracey.</p>
<p>Daphne had thought about that during lunch, with a sick feeling
in her stomach unlike anything she'd felt before, and which had
caused her to stop eating halfway through her first plate.</p>
<p><em>What I See has to come to pass... it probably makes being
eaten by Lethifolds look like a tea party...</em></p>
<p>It wasn't any conscious decision that Daphne made, nothing like
Slytherins were supposed to do, no weighing of the benefits to
herself.</p>
<p>Instead -</p>
<p>Daphne told Hannah and Susan and everyone, that her informant
had warned her that the next bully was going to target Hufflepuffs
in particular, and that the bully planned to risk the teachers'
wrath in order to <em>really</em> hurt either Hannah or Susan, like
<em>seriously</em>, and the two of them needed to stay out of this
one.</p>
<p>Hannah had agreed to stay out of it.</p>
<p>Susan had -</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"<em>What are you doing here?</em> " yelled General Granger,
though it was sort of a yell and a whisper at the same time.</p>
<p>Susan's round face didn't change, like the Hufflepuff girl had
suddenly developed the sort of experienced blankness that Daphne's
own Mother used. "Am I here, really?" Susan said calmly.</p>
<p>"<em>You said you wouldn't come!</em> "</p>
<p>"Did I say that?" said Susan. She flipped her wand casually in
one hand, leaning against the stone wall of the corridor where they
were waiting, her reddish-brown hair somehow arranging itself in
perfect order against the yellow trim of her witch's robes. "I
wonder why. Maybe I didn't want Hannah to get any strange ideas.
Hufflepuff loyalty, you know."</p>
<p>"If you don't leave," said the Sunshine General, "I'll call a
mission abort, and we'll <em>all</em> go back to our study halls,
Miss Bones!"</p>
<p>"<em>Hey!</em> " said Lavender. "We didn't vote on -"</p>
<p>"That's fine by me," said Susan, who was keeping a steady gaze
on the other end of the corridor where it merged into the tiled
hallway where they'd been told to expect the bully. "I'll just stay
here myself, then."</p>
<p>"Why -" said Daphne. Her heart was in her throat. <em>If I try
to change it, if</em> anyone <em>tries to change it, really
terrible, awful, no good, extremely bad things will happen. And
then it'll come to pass anyway...</em> "Why are you doing
this?"</p>
<p>"It's not like me," said Susan. "I know. But -" Susan shrugged.
"People don't always behave like themselves, you know."</p>
<p>They pleaded.</p>
<p>They begged.</p>
<p>Susan didn't even say anything anymore, she just kept watching,
waiting.</p>
<p>Daphne was nearly crying, she kept wondering if she'd
<em>caused</em> this, if trying to change Fate was making this
happen <em>worse</em> -</p>
<p>"Daphne," said Hermione, her voice sounding much higher than
usual, "go get a teacher. Run."</p>
<p>Daphne spun on her heels and started to pelt down the other
direction of the stony corridor, and then she realized, and she
turned back to where all the other girls except Susan were watching
her go, and Daphne, feeling like she was about to throw up, said,
"I can't..."</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " said Hermione.</p>
<p>"I think it gets worse every time you try to fight it," said
Daphne. That was how it worked in plays, sometimes.</p>
<p>Hermione stared at her, and then Hermione said, "Padma."</p>
<p>The other Ravenclaw girl just tore right out of there without
arguing. Daphne watched her go, knowing that Padma wasn't as good a
runner as her, and now wondering if maybe that would turn out to be
the <em>only reason</em> why help would come too late...</p>
<p>"Bullies are here," Susan said laconically. "Huh, they've got a
hostage."</p>
<p>They all whirled, and looked, and saw -</p>
<p><em>Three</em> older bullies, Daphne's eyes recognized Reese
Belka who was a top lieutenant in one of the seventh-year armies,
and Randolph Lee who was number two in the Hogwarts dueling club,
and worst of all, Robert Jugson III, in his sixth year, whose
father was almost certainly a Death Eater.</p>
<p>All three were surrounded by Shielding Charms, blue hazes that
glowed beneath the surface in ribbons of other color and showed
occasional faceting above, multi-layered shields like the three of
them thought they were fighting serious duelists and had expended
energy accordingly.</p>
<p>And behind them, bound and supported by glowing ropes, was
Hannah Abbott. Her eyes were wide and panicked and her mouth was
moving, though they couldn't hear anything through the
<em>Quietus</em> they'd put up earlier.</p>
<p>Then Jugson made an offhand gesture with his wand, and the
glowing ropes flung Hannah at them, there was a small pop as
Hannah's body blew through the Quieting barrier, Susan's wand was
instantly pointing at Hannah and Susan's voice muttered
"<em>Wingardium Leviosa</em>" -</p>
<p>"<em>Run!</em> " screamed Hannah, as she was gently lowered to
the ground.</p>
<p>But the corridor behind them and in front of them was now
blocked with a glowing gray field, a barrier spell that Daphne
didn't recognize.</p>
<p>"Do I need to explain what this is about?" Lee said with false
joviality. The seventh-year duelist was sporting a smile that
didn't reach his eyes. "Well, just in case, you little
inconveniences, and that includes you Miss Greengrass, you've been
quite enough trouble and you've told quite enough lies. We brought
your little friend just to make sure everyone knew we got all of
you - though I suppose the other Ravenclaw girl is hiding around a
corner or clinging to the ceiling somewhere? Well, no matter. This
is your -"</p>
<p>"Enough talk," said Robert Jugson III, "time for pain," and
raised his wand. "<em>Cluthe!</em> "</p>
<p>Simultaneously Susan pointed her wand and said
"<em>Prismatis!</em> " and a small rainbow sphere formed in midair
almost instantly, the miniature barrier so condensed and bright
that it stayed intact even as Jugson's hex hit it and bounced off
toward Belka, whose wand flashed to swat away the dark bolt; and
then a moment later the many-colored blaze was gone.</p>
<p>Daphne's eyes went wide for a moment; she'd never thought of
using a Prismatic Sphere like <em>that</em> -</p>
<p>"Jugsy, honey?" said Belka. Her lips widened in a vicious smile.
"I thought we discussed this. First we beat them, <em>then</em> we
play."</p>
<p>"P-please," said Hermione Granger in a faltering voice, "let
them go - I, I, I promise I'll -"</p>
<p>"Oh, really," said Lee in an annoyed tone. "Are you about to
offer to turn yourself over if we let the others go? We've got
<em>all</em> of you, now."</p>
<p>Jugson smiled, then. "It could be funny," said the sixth-year
junior Death Eater, softly and with menace. "How about if you lick
my shoes, mudblood, and <em>one</em> of your friends can go? Pick
whichever one you like best, leave the others to get hurt."</p>
<p>"Nope," said the young voice of Susan Bones, "not going to
happen," and with a blindingly fast motion the Hufflepuff girl
leapt leftward just as a red stunbolt erupted from Belka's wand,
Daphne could hardly <em>see</em> the movement as Susan seemed to
hit the corridor wall and then bounce off it like she was a rubber
ball and her legs smashed into Jugson's <em>face</em>, it didn't go
through the shield but the sixth-year went sprawling backward with
the impact and Susan followed him downward and her foot stamped
down on the boy's wand arm, again being repelled by the shield,
"<em>Elmekia!</em> " shouted Lee and Parvati shouted
"<em>Prismatis!</em> " and the rainbow wall formed but the fiery
blue blast passed right through it like it wasn't even there, the
bolt missed Susan by inches, there was a whirlwind of motion that
Daphne couldn't follow during which Belka had her feet knocked out
from under her, but the older witch just rolled back to a stand and
then -</p>
<p>Daphne saw it coming, and her lips started to mouth
"<em>Pris-</em>" but it was already too late.</p>
<p>Three blasts of brilliance slammed into Susan at once, she had
her wand raised as though she could counter them and there was a
white flash as the hexes struck the magical wood, but then Susan's
legs convulsed and sent her flying into a corridor wall. Her head
hit with a strange cracking sound, and then Susan fell down and lay
motionless with her head at an odd-seeming angle, her wand still
clutched in one outstretched hand.</p>
<p>There was a moment of frozen silence.</p>
<p>Parvati scrambled over to where Susan lay, pressed a thumb over
the pulse point on Susan's wrist, and then - then slowly,
tremblingly, Parvati rose to her feet, her eyes huge -</p>
<p>"<em>Vitalis revelio</em>," said Lee just as Parvati opened her
mouth, and Susan's body was surrounded by a warm red glow. Now the
seventh-year boy really was grinning. "Probably just a broken
collarbone, I'd say. Nice try, though."</p>
<p>"Merlin, they <em>are</em> tricky," said Jugson.</p>
<p>"You had me going for a second there, dearies." The seventh-year
girl wasn't smiling at all.</p>
<p>"<em>Tonare!</em> " screamed Daphne, raising her wand above her
head and focusing harder than she ever had in her life. "<em>Rava
calvaria! Lucis -</em>"</p>
<p>She didn't even see the hex that got her.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Hermione felt the jolt of Innervation bringing her awake, and
out of some intuitive strategism she <em>didn't</em> roll to her
feet right away; it had been a completely hopeless battle and she
didn't know what she could do but some instinct told her that
leaping to her feet wasn't it.</p>
<p>Just a crack, Hermione opened her eyes, and the thin rays of
light that entered them showed Parvati backing away from all three
bullies, the last girl standing that Hermione could see.</p>
<p>And her eyes also showed Tracey fallen not far away from her,
and Hermione's wand was still in her hand; and so, desperately
hoping the Slytherin girl would show more sense than she usually
did, Hermione made the wand movements as subtly as she could, and
hardly moving her lips, whispered, "Innervate."</p>
<p>Hermione felt the spell working, but Tracey didn't move.
Hermione hoped it was because Tracey was being cunning, and waiting
to...</p>
<p>What <em>could</em> they do?</p>
<p>Hermione didn't know, and the panic that had waited through the
moments of fighting was starting to eat her up inside now that she
was still, now that she was trying to think, now that she could see
that it was all absolutely hopeless.</p>
<p>That was when Hermione heard a thud, and though it was out of
her field of vision now, she knew that Parvati had fallen.</p>
<p>A moment of silence came, and passed.</p>
<p>"Now what?" said the voice of the scary-soft boy.</p>
<p>"Now we wake up the mudblood," said the precise voice of the
scary-formal boy, "and find out who's <em>really</em> behind them,
not Salazar Slytherin's ghost."</p>
<p>"No, dears," said the voice of the scary-sweet girl,
"<em>first</em> we bind them all <em>very</em> securely -"</p>
<p>And then there was a sound like lightning and thunder and
Hermione's eyes widened in shock before she could stop herself, and
in her widened field of vision she saw the scary-soft boy
convulsing as yellow arcs of energy crawled over him like giant
blazing worms. His wand flew out of his hand as he collapsed to the
ground, twitching, and then a moment later he lay still.</p>
<p>"Is everyone else asleep now?" said a voice. "Good."</p>
<p>Susan Bones rose from the floor near where the scary-soft boy
had stood, neck still oddly bent. Then she rolled her head around
her shoulders, a casual loose motion, and her head was straight
again.</p>
<p>The round-faced first-year girl stood facing the remaining two
bullies with one hand cocked on her hip.</p>
<p>Grinning.</p>
<p>And surrounded by faceted blue haze.</p>
<p>"Polyjuice!" spat the bully-girl.</p>
<p>"<em>Polyfluis Reverso!</em> " roared the remaining boy
bully.</p>
<p>Something like the form of a mirrored scarf spat out of his wand
-</p>
<p>Passed without resistance through the haze surrounding Susan
-</p>
<p>For an instant, she glowed in a strange mirror-color, like a
reflection of herself -</p>
<p>And then the glow faded.</p>
<p>The young girl still stood there, hand on her hip.</p>
<p>"Wrong," said Susan.</p>
<p>"And <em>this</em> is the truth," said Susan. "In case nobody
ever told you -"</p>
<p>In her small hand a wand rose up, blurred by the blue haze
surrounding it.</p>
<p>"You don't mess with the 'Puffs," said Susan, and with a grey
flash so bright it hurt Hermione's half-closed eyes, the real
battle started.</p>
<p>It went on for a while.</p>
<p>Some of the ceiling got melted.</p>
<p>The girl-bully tried to cry a truce, that they would leave and
take Jugson with them, and Susan roared out the syllables of a
curse Hermione recognized as Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting which was
illegal in seven countries.</p>
<p>Eventually the girl-bully lay unconscious and unawakenable on
the ground, and the last boy-bully had fled leaving his companions'
bodies behind, and Susan was leaned over against one wall, covered
in sweat and her scorched robes soaked through with wet spots,
gasping for breath, and clutching at her right shoulder using her
left hand.</p>
<p>After a while Susan straightened up, and turned to look back at
where her fellow witches were sleeping on the floor.</p>
<p>Well, they <em>should've</em> been sleeping on the floor.</p>
<p>Lavender was already sitting up with eyes as wide as
watermelons.</p>
<p>"That..." said Lavender.</p>
<p>"Was..." said Tracey.</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " said Hermione.</p>
<p>"I mean, <em>what?</em> " said Parvati.</p>
<p>"<em>Cool!</em> " said Lavender.</p>
<p>"Oh, hell," said Susan Bones. Her face had already looked a
little pale beneath the sweat, and now it was getting paler,
looking almost frighteningly white. "Ah... could I convince you
that you hallucinated all that?"</p>
<p>There was a rapid exchange of glances. Hermione looked at
Parvati, Parvati looked at Lavender, Lavender briefly locked gazes
with Tracey.</p>
<p>The four of them looked back at Susan and shook their heads.</p>
<p>"Oh, hell," said Susan again. "Look I'll be back in a few
minutes but I've really got to go now <em>please</em> don't say
anything bye!"</p>
<p>And Susan ran out into the hallway, moving surprisingly fast,
before anyone could say another word.</p>
<p>"No, seriously, <em>what?</em> " said Parvati.</p>
<p>"<em>Innervate</em>," said Hermione, pointing her wand at
Daphne, whose body she hadn't been able to see before; and Lavender
pointed her wand at Hannah's body and said the same.</p>
<p>Hannah's eyes opened and she tried frantically to roll to her
feet, but collapsed to the ground halfway through.</p>
<p>"It's okay, Hannah!" said Lavender. "We won."</p>
<p>"We <em>what?</em> " said Hannah from her little heap on the
floor.</p>
<p>Daphne hadn't stirred, but Hermione could see her chest rising
and falling, and the breathing rhythm looked normal enough. "I
think she's okay," said Hermione, "but -" She took a moment to
swallow, her mouth was still dry. This had all gotten way, way,
<em>way</em> out of hand. "I think we ought to take Daphne to Madam
Pomfrey's..."</p>
<p>"Sure, sure, just <em>give me a second here</em> and I'll
<em>probably be fine</em>," said Parvati.</p>
<p>"Ex<em>cuse</em> me," Hannah said in a tone that was polite, but
firm. "How did we win? And why does the ceiling look all
melty?"</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"Susan did it," said Tracey.</p>
<p>"Yeah," said Parvati, voice only slightly shaky as she stood up
and started to brush off her red-trimmed robes, "it turns out that
Susan Bones is the Heir of Hufflepuff and she's opened up the
long-lost entrance to Helga Hufflepuff's Chamber of Hard Work and
Practice."</p>
<p>"<em>Huh?</em> " said Hannah, who was feeling over herself as if
to make sure all her body parts were still there. "I thought that
was just something Professor Sprout says to teach us an Important
Moral Lesson - <em>Susan</em> is?"</p>
<p>Slowly, Hermione was beginning to feel a bit more together. It
hadn't really been more than thirty seconds of extreme terror, at
least not the parts she'd been conscious for. "Actually," Hermione
said carefully, as her mind started to work again, "I'm pretty sure
that <em>is</em> just something Professor Sprout says, it wasn't in
<em>Hogwarts: A History</em> or anywhere else I've read -"</p>
<p>"<em>She's a double witch!</em> " shouted Tracey, her voice so
high it cracked. "She <em>is!</em> She's one of <em>them!</em>
She's been this whole time!"</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em> " yelled Parvati, twisting around to look at
Tracey. "That is the <em>looniest</em> thing -"</p>
<p>"Of <em>course!</em> " said Lavender, now all the way on her
feet and starting to bounce up and down with excitement. "I
should've <em>realized!</em> "</p>
<p>"Susan's a <em>what?</em> " said Hermione.</p>
<p>"A <em>double</em> witch!" said Tracey.</p>
<p>"You see," said Lavender, speaking very rapidly, "There've
always been stories, about these children who are born as super
magicians who can cast spells no one else can, and there's a whole
secret school hidden inside Hogwarts with classes that only they
can see and go to -"</p>
<p>"Those are just <em>stories!</em> " yelled Parvati. "That's not
how real life works! I mean, sure, I read those books too -"</p>
<p>"Just a minute, please," said Hermione. Maybe her mind
<em>was</em> feeling a little slow after all. "You mean even though
you <em>already</em> get to go to a magical school and everything,
you still want to go to a <em>double</em> magical school?"</p>
<p>Lavender looked at her, puzzled. "What?" said Lavender. "Who
<em>wouldn't</em> want to have super extra magical powers? It would
be like this whole amazing <em>destiny</em> and everything! It'd
mean you were <em>special!</em> "</p>
<p>Hannah nodded to that, looking up from where she'd crawled to
Daphne's side and was checking the girl for broken bones. "I wish
<em>I</em> was a double witch," Hannah said, and then, sounding a
little sadder, "though I don't believe there is any such thing,
really... what did you see Susan do, exactly? I mean, are you sure
you weren't just seeing things after getting stunned?"</p>
<p>Hermione truly, truly couldn't find any words at this point.</p>
<p>"Oh, no," said Tracey. The Slytherin girl spun around to look at
the entrance to the corridor, her robes fluttering around her. "Oh
no! We've got to get out of here! We've got to get away before
Susan comes back with someone who can Super-Memory-Charm us!"</p>
<p>"Susan wouldn't <em>do</em> that!" said Parvati. "I mean, if
there even <em>was</em> -"</p>
<p>"WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?" roared a high-pitched squeaky voice, as
Professor Flitwick stormed into the partially melted corridor like
a small, dangerously compressed package of pure academic fury, an
ashen-faced Padma gasping along behind him.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"What <em>happened?</em> " Susan blurted to the girl who looked
exactly like her, except for the scorched robes damp with
sweat.</p>
<p>"Ooh, great question!" said the other Susan Bones as she rapidly
skinned off what was left of her borrowed clothes. A moment later
the girl began to Metamorphose back into her more accustomed form
of Nymphadora Tonks. "Sorry but I couldn't think of anything myself
so you've got about three minutes to decide on an answer to that
-"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>As Daphne Greengrass observed afterward with some acidity, the
flaw in Hermione's cunning plan to make sure that House points were
taken evenly from all four Houses if they got caught, was that it
didn't work on <em>detentions</em>.</p>
<p>They'd all agreed to keep their mouths shut about Susan's
mysterious powers - even Tracey, after Susan threatened to have her
Super-Memory-Charmed if she didn't promise. Unfortunately, they
discovered at dinnertime that someone had forgotten to tell the
<em>bullies</em> about their agreement, and also that Susan Bones
had sacrificed her soul to dreadful forbidden powers which now
inhabited the hulk of her body and that was why they'd all gotten
detention.</p>
<p>"Hermione?" Harry Potter said to her from beside her at the
dinner table, his voice very tentative. "Please don't take offense,
and I'll understand if you say it's none of my business, but I
think all this is starting to spin out of control."</p>
<p>Hermione went on mashing the slice of chocolate cake on her
plate into a seamless mush of cake and icing. "Yes," Hermione said,
her voice might have been a little acerbic, "that was what I said
to Professor Flitwick while I was apologizing to him, that I knew
things had gotten out of hand, and he yelled: <em>Really, Miss
Granger? Do you think?</em> in a squeak so loud that my ears caught
on fire. I mean my ears <em>actually caught on fire</em>. Professor
Flitwick had to put them out again."</p>
<p>Harry had put his hand to his forehead. "Excuse me," Harry said.
His face was perfectly straight. "Sometimes I still have a little
trouble getting used to that sort of thing. Hey, Hermione, remember
when we were young and naive and we still thought the world was a
relatively understandable place?"</p>
<p>Hermione put her fork down and looked at him for a moment. "Do
you sometimes wish you were a Muggle, Harry?"</p>
<p>"<em>Huh?</em> " said Harry. "Well, of course not! I mean, even
if I was a Muggle, I'd probably have tried someday to take over the
worrrrlllll-" as Hermione gave him a <em>look</em> and the boy
hastily swallowed the word and said, "I mean <em>optimize</em> of
course, you <em>know</em> that's what I really mean, Hermione! My
point is, it's not like my <em>goals</em> would change one way or
another. But with magic it's going to be a lot easier to get things
done than if I had to do stuff using only the Muggle capability
set. If you think about it logically, that's <em>why</em> I'm going
to Hogwarts instead of just ignoring all this and studying for a
career in nanotechnology."</p>
<p>Hermione, having finished hand-crafting her Chocolate Cake
Sauce, began to dip her carrots in it and eat them.</p>
<p>"Why do you ask?" said Harry. "Do <em>you</em> wish you were
back in the Muggle world?"</p>
<p>"Not exactly," Hermione said, as she crunched into both the
carrot and the chocolate. "I was just, well, feeling strange about
having <em>wanted</em> to be a witch... Did you want to be a wizard
when you were little?"</p>
<p>"Of course," Harry said promptly. "I also wanted psychic powers
and super-strength and adamantium-reinforced bones and my own
flying castle and sometimes I felt sad that I might have to settle
for just being a famous scientist and an astronaut."</p>
<p>Hermione nodded. "You know," she said softly, "I think the
witches and wizards who <em>grow up</em> here don't really
appreciate magic properly..."</p>
<p>"Well, of course they don't," Harry said, "that's what gives us
our advantage. Isn't that obvious? I mean seriously, that was
bloody obvious to me within five minutes of walking into Diagon
Alley." There was a puzzled look on the boy's face, like he
couldn't understand why she was paying attention to something so
ordinary.</p>
